<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> landscape shows many shades of green; deep forests, mostly
coniferous, extend from the valley of the Rednitz to that of the
Tauber. Yet the villages lie in the midst of great circles of
cultivated land, for the tillage of man is immemorial here.
Around the many weirs the grass grows higher, so high often that
you can see only the beaks of the droves of geese, and were it not
for their cackle you might take these beaks to be strangely mobile
flowers.</p>

<p>The little town of Eschenbach lies quite flat on the plain. In
it a fragment of the Middle Ages has survived, but no strangers
know it, since hours of travel divide it from any railway. Ansbach
is the nearest point in the great system of modern traffic; to
get there you must use a stage-coach. And that is as true to-day as
it was in the days when Gottfried Nothafft, the weaver, lived there.</p>

<p>The town walls are overgrown with moss and ivy; the old drawbridges
still cross the moats and take you through the round, ruined
gates into the streets. The houses have bay-windows and far-projecting
overhangs, and their interlacing beams look like the
criss-cross of muscles on an anatomical chart.</p>

<p>Concerning the poet who was once born here and who sang the
song of Parsifal, all living memory has faded. Perhaps the fountains
whisper of him by night; perhaps sometimes when the moon
is up, his shadow hovers about the church or the town-hall. The
men and women know nothing of him any more.</p>

<p>The little house of the weaver, withdrawn by a short distance
from the street, stood not far from the inn at the sign of the Ox.
Three worn steps took you to its door, and six windows looked out
upon the quiet square. It is strange to reflect that the spirit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>modern industrialism hewed its destructive path even to this forgotten
nook of the world.</p>

<p>In 1849, at the time of Gottfried Nothafft&#8217;s marriage&mdash;his wife,
Marian, was one of the two H&ouml;llriegel sisters of Nuremberg&mdash;he
had still been able to earn a tolerable living. So the couple
desired a child, but desired it for years in vain. Often, at the
end of the day&#8217;s work, when Gottfried sat on the bench in front
of his house and smoked his pipe, he would say: &#8220;How good it
would be if we had a son.&#8221; Marian would fall silent and lower
her eyes.</p>

<p>As time passed, he stopped saying that, because he would not
put the woman to shame. But his expression betrayed his desire
all the more clearly.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>A day came on which his trade seemed to come to a halt. The
weavers in all the land complained that they could not keep their
old pace. It was as though a creeping paralysis had come upon
them. The market prices suddenly dropped, and the character of
the goods was changed.</p>

<p>This took place toward the end of the eighteen hundred and
fifties, when the new power looms were being introduced from
America. No toil profited anything. The cheap product which
the machines could furnish destroyed the sale of the hand-made
weaves.</p>

<p>At first Gottfried Nothafft refused to be cast down. Thus the
wheel of a machine will run on for a space after the power has
been cut off. But gradually his courage failed. His hair turned
grey in a single winter, and at the age of forty-five he was a
broken man.</p>

<p>And just as poverty appeared threatening at their door, and the
soul of Marian began to be stained by hatred, the longing of the
couple was fulfilled, and the wife became pregnant in the tenth
year of their marriage.</p>

<p>The hatred which she nourished was directed against the power
loom. In her dreams she saw the machine as a monster with
thighs of steel, which screamed out its malignity and devoured the
hearts of men. She was embittered by the injustice of a process
which gave to impudence and sloth the product that had once come
thoughtfully and naturally from the careful hands of men.</p>

<p>One journeyman after another had to be discharged, and one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>hand-loom after another to be stored in the attic. On many days
Marian would slip up the stairs and crouch for hours beside the
looms, which had once been set in motion by a determinable and
beneficent exertion and were like corpses now.</p>

<p>Gottfried wandered across country, peddling the stock of goods
he had on hand. Once on his return he brought with him a piece
of machine-made cloth which a merchant of N&ouml;rdlingen had given
him. &#8220;Look, Marian, see what sort of stuff it is,&#8221; he said, and
handed it to her. But Marian drew her hand away, and shuddered
as though she had seen the booty of a murderer.</p>

<p>After the birth of her boy she lost these morbid feelings; Gottfried
on the other hand seemed to dwindle from month to month.
Though he outlasted the years, there was no cheer left in him and
he got no comfort even from his growing boy. When he had sold
all his own wares, he took those of others, and dragged himself
wearily in summer and winter from village to village.</p>

<p>In spite of the scarcity that prevailed in the house, Marian was
convinced that Gottfried had put by money, and certain hints
which he threw out confirmed her in this hope. It was one of his
peculiar views that it was better to leave his wife in the dark regarding
the true state of their fortunes. As their circumstances
grew worse, he became wholly silent on this point.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>On the square of the grain merchants in Nuremberg, Jason
Philip Schimmelweis, the husband of Marian&#8217;s sister, had his bookbinder&#8217;s
shop.</p>

<p>Schimmelweis was a Westphalian. Hatred against the junkers
and the priests had driven him to this Protestant city of the South,
where from the beginning he had acquired the respect of people
through his ready wit and speech. Theresa H&ouml;llriegel had lodged
in the house in which he opened his shop, and gained her living
as a seamstress. He had thought that she had some money, but it
had proved to be too little for his ambitious notions. When he
discovered that, he treated Theresa as though she had cheated him.</p>

<p>He held his trade in contempt, and was ambitious of greater
things. He felt that he was called to be a bookseller; but he had
no capital wherewith to realise this plan. So he sat morosely in
his subterranean shop, pasted and folded and quarrelled with his
lot, and in his hours of leisure read the writings of socialists and
freethinkers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>It was the Autumn in which the war against France was raging.
On that very morning had come the news of the battle of Sedan.
All the church bells were ringing.</p>

<p>To the surprise of Jason Philip, Gottfried Nothafft stepped into
his shop. His long, patriarchal beard and tall stature gave something
venerable to his appearance, even though his face looked
tired and his eyes were dull.</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless you, brother,&#8221; he said and held out his hand. &#8220;The
fatherland has better luck than its citizens.&#8221;</p>

<p>Schimmelweis, who did not like the visits of kinsmen, returned
the salutation with careful coolness. His features did not brighten
until he heard that his brother-in-law was stopping at the Red
Cock Inn. He asked what errand had brought Gottfried to the
city.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have a talk with you,&#8221; Nothafft replied.</p>

<p>They entered a room behind the shop and sat down. Jason
Philip&#8217;s eyes harboured even now a definitely negative answer to
any proposal that might cost him money or trouble. But he was
to be agreeably disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to tell you, brother,&#8221; Gottfried Nothafft said, &#8220;that
I have put by three thousand taler during the nineteen years of my
married life. And since I have the feeling that I am not long for
this world, I have come to ask you to take charge of the money
for Marian and the boy. It has been troublesome enough not to
touch it in these evil times that have come. Marian knows nothing
of it, and I don&#8217;t want her to know. She is a weak woman, and
women do not understand money nor the worth and dignity it has
when it has been earned so bitterly hard. In some hour of difficulty
she would begin to use it, and presently it would be gone.
But I want to ease Daniel&#8217;s entry into life, when his years of
training and apprenticeship are over. He is twelve now. In another
twelve years he will be, God willing, a man. You can help
Marian with the interest, and all I ask of you is to be silent and to
act a father&#8217;s part toward the boy when I shall be no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jason Philip Schimmelweis arose. He was moved and wrung
Gottfried Nothafft&#8217;s hand. &#8220;You may rely upon me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as
you would on the Bank of England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought that would be your answer, brother, and that is why
I came.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put down on the table three thousand taler in bank notes
of the realm, and Jason Philip wrote out a receipt. Then he
urged him to stay that night at his house. But Gottfried Nothafft
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>said that he must return home to his wife and child, and that a
single night in the noisy city had been enough for him.</p>

<p>When they returned to the shop, they found Theresa sitting there.
In her lap she held Philippina, her first-born, who was three years
old. The child had a large head and homely features. Gottfried
hardly stopped to answer his sister-in-law&#8217;s questions. Later Theresa
asked her husband what Gottfried&#8217;s business had been. Jason
Philip answered brusquely: &#8220;Nothing a woman would understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Three days later Gottfried sent back the receipt. On the back
of it he had written: &#8220;The paper is of no use; it might even betray
my secret. I have your word and your hand. That is enough.
With thanks for your friendship and your services, I am your
faithful kinsman, Gottfried Nothafft.&#8221;</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Before peace had been made with France, Gottfried lay down to
die. He was buried in the little churchyard by the wall, and a
cross was set upon his grave.</p>

<p>Jason Philip and Theresa had come to the funeral, and stayed
for three days. An examination of her inheritance showed, to
Marian&#8217;s consternation, that there were not twenty taler in the
house, and what she saw ahead of her was a life of wretchedness
and want. Jason Philip&#8217;s counsel and his plan were a genuine
consolation to her, and his declaration that he would stand by her
to the best of his ability eased her heart.</p>

<p>It was determined that she was to open a little shop, and Jason
advanced her one hundred taler. All the while he had the air of
a made man. He held his head high, and his fat little cheeks
glowed with health. He was fond of drumming with his fingers
on the window pane and of whistling. The tune he whistled
was the Marseillaise, but that tune was not known in Eschenbach.</p>

<p>Daniel observed carefully his uncle&#8217;s lips, and whistled the tune
after him. Jason Philip laughed so that his little belly quivered.
Then he remembered that it was a house of mourning, and said:
&#8220;What a boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>But really he did not like the boy. &#8220;Our excellent Gottfried
does not seem to have trained him carefully,&#8221; he remarked once,
when Daniel showed some childish recalcitrance. &#8220;The boy needs
a strong hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel heard these words, and looked scornfully into his uncle&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>Sunday afternoon, when the coffee had been served, the Schimmelweis
couple was ready to leave. But Daniel was not to be
found. The wife of the inn-keeper called out across the road
that she had seen him follow the organist to church. Marian ran
to the church to fetch him. After a while she returned, and said
to Jason Philip, who was waiting: &#8220;He&#8217;s crouching in the organ
loft, and I can&#8217;t get him to move.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t get him to move?&#8221; Jason Philip started up, and his little
red cheeks gleamed with rage. &#8220;What does that mean? How
can you tolerate that?&#8221; And he himself proceeded to the church
to get the disobedient child.</p>

<p>As he was mounting the organ-loft he met the organist, who
laughed and said: &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re looking for Daniel? He&#8217;s
still staring at the organ, as though my bit of playing had bewitched
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drive the witch-craft out of him,&#8221; Jason Philip snarled.</p>

<p>Daniel was crouching on the floor behind the organ, and did not
stir at his uncle&#8217;s call. He was so absorbed that the expression of
his eyes made his uncle wonder whether the boy was really sane.
He grasped Daniel&#8217;s shoulder, and spoke in a tone of violent command:
&#8220;Come home with me this minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel looked up, awoke from his dream, and became aware of
the indignant hiss of that alien voice. He tore himself away, and
declared insolently that he would stay where he was. That enraged
Jason Philip utterly, and he tried again to lay hands on the
boy in order to drag him down by force. Daniel leapt back, and
cried with a quivering voice: &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the silence of the nave that had an admonishing
and terrifying effect on Jason Philip. Perhaps the extraordinary
malignity and passion in the little fellow&#8217;s face caused him to
desist. At all events he turned around and went without another
word.</p>

<p>&#8220;The stage-coach is waiting. We&#8217;ll be late!&#8221; his wife called
out to him.</p>

<p>He turned a sinister face to Marian. &#8220;You&#8217;re bringing up a
fine product, I must say. You&#8217;ll have your own troubles with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marian&#8217;s eyes fell. She was not unprepared for the reproach.
She was herself frightened at the boy&#8217;s savage obduracy, his self-centred
insistence on his imaginings, his hardness and impatience
and contempt of all restraint. It seemed to her as though fate had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>inspired the soul of her child with something of the foolish and
torturing hatred which she had nursed during her pregnancy.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Jason Philip Schimmelweis left the dark basement on the square,
rented a shop near the bridge by the museum, and set up as a
bookseller. Thus his old ambition was realised at last.</p>

<p>He hired a shop-assistant, and Theresa sat all day at the till and
learned to keep books.</p>

<p>When she asked her husband what was the source of his capital,
he answered that a friend who had great confidence in his ability
had advanced him the money at a low rate of interest. He added
that he had been pledged not to divulge the name of his friend.</p>

<p>Theresa did not believe him. Her mind was full of dark forebodings.
She brooded incessantly and grew to be watchful and
suspicious. In secret she tried to ferret out the identity of this
nameless friend, but came upon no trace. Now and then she
tried to cross-question Jason Philip. On such occasions he would
snarl at her malignantly. There was no talk of the return of the
money or of the payment of interest on it, nor did the books show
an entry of any sort. To rid herself of the anxieties that accompanied
her through the years, it would have been necessary for
Theresa to believe in helpful fairies. And she did not believe in
them.</p>

<p>Nature had given her neither gaiety nor gentleness; under the
pressure of this insoluble mystery she became ill-tempered as a
wife and moody as a mother.</p>

<p>When there were no customers in the shop she would pick up
books quite at random and read in them. Sometimes it was a novel
dealing with crime, sometimes a garrulous tract dealing with secret
vices. Such things were needed to attract a public that regarded
the buying of books as a sinful waste. Without special pleasure,
and with a morose sort of thirst for information, she read revelations
of court life and the printed betrayals of all kinds of spies,
adventurers, and rogues. Quite unconsciously she came to judge
the world to which she had no real access according to these books
which offered her as truth the issues of sick and pestilential minds.</p>

<p>But as the years went on, and prosperity raised Jason Philip
definitely into the merchant class, he abandoned the shadier side
of his business. He was a man who knew his age and who unfurled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>his sails when he was sure of a favourable wind. He
entrusted his ship more and more to the ever swelling current of
the political parties of the proletariat, and hoped to find his profit
where, in a half-hearted way, his convictions lay. He exhibited
a rebel&#8217;s front to the middle-classes, and held out a hand of unctuous
fellowship to the toiler. He knew how to make his way!
Many an insignificant shop-keeper had been known to exchange
his musty rooms for a villa in the suburbs, to furnish it pretentiously,
and to send his sons on trips abroad.</p>

<p>In these days, too, the old imperial city awoke from its romantic
slumber. Once the sublime churches, the lovely curves of the
bridges, and the quaint gables of the houses had formed an artistic
whole. Now they became mere remnants. Castle and walls and
mighty towers were ruins of an age of dreams now fortunately
past. Iron rails were laid on the streets and rusty chains with
strangely shaped lanterns were removed from the opening of
narrow streets. Factories and smoke-stacks surrounded the venerable
and picturesque city as an iron frame might surround the work
of some old master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Modern man has got to have light and air,&#8221; said Jason Philip
Schimmelweis, and clinked the coins in his trousers pocket.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Daniel attended the <i>gymnasium</i> at Ansbach. He was to complete
the course of studies that would entitle him to the reduction
of his military service to one year and then enter business. This
had been agreed upon between Jason Philip and Marian.</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s zeal for study was small. His teachers shook their
heads. Their considerable experience of the world had never yet
offered them a being so constituted. He listened more eagerly
to the lowing of a herd of cows and to the twittering of the
sparrows than to the best founded principles of grammatical science.
Some of them thought him dull, others malicious. He passed
from class to class with difficulty and solely by virtue of a marvellous
faculty of guessing. At especially critical moments he was
saved through the help and advocacy of the music-master Spindler.</p>

<p>The families who gave the poor student his meals complained
of his bad manners. The wife of Judge Hahn forbade him the
house on account of his boorish answers. &#8220;Beggars must not be
choosers,&#8221; she had called out after him.</p>

<p>Spindler was a man who asserted quite correctly that he had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>meant for better things than wearing himself out in a provincial
town. His white locks framed a face ennobled by the melancholy
that speaks of lost ideals and illusions.</p>

<p>One summer morning Spindler had risen with the sun and gone
for a long walk in the country. When he reached the first barn
of the village of Dautenwinden he saw a company of strolling
musicians, who had played dance music the evening before and
far into the night, and who were now shaking from their hair and
garments the straw and chaff amid which they had slept. Above
them, under the open gable of the barn, Daniel Nothafft was
lying in the straw. With an absorbed and devout expression he
was seeking to elicit a melody from a flute which one of the
musicians had loaned him.</p>

<p>Spindler stood still and looked up. The musicians laughed, but
he did not share in their merriment. A long while passed before
the unskilful player of the flute became aware of his teacher.
Then he climbed down and tried to steal away with a shy greeting.
Spindler stopped him. They walked on together, and Daniel confessed
that he had not been able to tear himself away from the
musicians since the preceding afternoon. The lad of fourteen was
not able to express his feeling; but it seemed to him as though a
higher power had forced him to breathe the same air at least with
those who made music.</p>

<p>From that day on and for three years Daniel visited Spindler
twice a week, and was most thoroughly grounded in counterpoint
and harmony. The hours thus spent were both consecrated and
winged. Spindler found a peculiar happiness in nourishing a passion
whose development struck him as a reward for his many years
of toneless isolation. And though the desperateness of this passion,
though the rebelliousness and aimless wildness which streamed to
him not only from the character of his pupil but also from that
pupil&#8217;s first attempts at composition, gave him cause for anxiety,
yet he hoped always to soothe the boy by pointing to the high and
serene models and masters of his art.</p>

<p>And so the time came in which Daniel was to earn his own
bread.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Spindler journeyed to Eschenbach to confer with Marian
Nothafft.</p>

<p>The woman did not understand him. She felt tempted to laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p><p>Music had meant in her life the droning of a hurdy-gurdy, the
singing of a club of men, the marching of a military band. Was
her boy to wander from door to door and fiddle for pennies?
Spindler seemed a mere madman to her. She pressed her hands
together, and looked at him as at a man who was wasting trivial
words on a tragic disaster. The music-master realised that his
influence was as narrow as his world, and was forced to leave without
accomplishing anything.</p>

<p>Marian wrote a letter to Jason Philip Schimmelweis.</p>

<p>One could almost see Jason Philip worrying his reddish brown
beard with his nimble fingers and the scornful twinkling of his
eyes; one could almost hear the sharp, northern inflection of his
speech when his answer to Daniel arrived: &#8220;I expected nothing else
of you than that it would be your dearest wish to be a wastrel.
My dear boy, either you buckle under and make up your mind to
become a decent member of society, or I leave you both to your
own devices. There is no living in selling herrings and pepper,
and so you will kindly imagine for yourself the fate of your
mother, especially if a parasite like yourself clings to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel tore up the letter into innumerable bits and let them
flutter out into the wind. His mother wept.</p>

<p>Then he went out into the forest, wandered about till nightfall,
and slept in the hollow of a tree.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>One might go on and tell the tale of continued rebellion, of
angry words on both sides, of pleas and complaints and fruitless
arguments, of bitter controversy and yet bitterer silence.</p>

<p>Daniel fled and returned and let the slothful days glide by,
stormed about in the vicinity, and lay in the high grass beside the
pools or opened his window at night, cursing the silence and envying
the clouds their speed.</p>

<p>His mother followed him when he went to his little room and
pressed her ear to the door, and then entered and saw the candle
still lit, and went to his bed and was frightened at his gleaming
eyes which grew sombre at her approach. Full of the memories
of her early cares and fears for him, and thinking that the darkness
and the sight of her weakness would prevail upon him, she pleaded
and begged once more. And he looked up at her and something
broke in his soul, and he promised to do as she demanded.</p>

<p>So we see him next at the house of the leather merchant Hamecher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>in Ansbach. He sits on a bale of leather in the long, dismal
passage way or on the cellar steps or in the store room, and dreams
and dreams and dreams. And gradually the worthy Hamecher&#8217;s
indulgent surprise turned to blank astonishment and then to indignation,
and at the end of six months he showed the useless fellow
the door.</p>

<p>Once more Jason Philip condescended to grant his favour, and
chose a new scene and new people for his nephew, if only to
remove him from Spindler&#8217;s baneful influence. At the mention
of the city of Bayreuth no one became aware of Daniel&#8217;s fiery
ecstasy, for they had never heard of the name of Richard Wagner
but always of the name of the wine merchant Maier. And so he
came to Bayreuth, the Jerusalem of his yearning, and forced himself
to an appearance of industry in order to remain in that spot
where sun and air and earth and the very beasts and stones and
refuse breathe that music of which Spindler had said that he himself
had a profound presentiment of its nature but was too old to
grasp and love it wholly.</p>

<p>Daniel did his best to make himself useful. But in spite of
himself he scrawled music notes on the invoices, roared strange
melodies in lonely vaults, and let the contents of a whole keg of
wine leak out, because in front of him, on the floor, lay the score
of the English Suites.</p>

<p>At a rehearsal he slipped into the Festival Playhouse, but was put
out by a zealous watchman, and on this occasion made the acquaintance
of Andreas D&ouml;derlein, who was a professor at the Nuremberg
conservatory and a tireless apostle of the redeemer. D&ouml;derlein
seemed not disinclined to understand and to help, and expressed a
real delight at the deep, original enthusiasm and burning devotion
of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. And Daniel, intoxicated by a rather vague and not
at all binding promise of a scholarship at the conservatory, fled
from Bayreuth by night, made his way on foot back to Eschenbach,
threw himself at his mother&#8217;s feet, and almost writhed there before
her and begged and implored her, and in words almost wild sought
to prevail on her to attempt to change the mind of Jason Philip.
He tried to explain to her that his life and happiness, his very blood
and heart were dedicated to this one thing. But she, who was once
kindly, was now hard&mdash;hard as stone, cold as ice. She understood
nothing, felt nothing, believed nothing, saw only the frightfulness,
as she called it, of his incurable aberration.</p>

<p>All these matters might have been related at length. But they
are as inevitable in their character and sequence as the sparks and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>smoke that follow upon fire. They are quite determinable; they
have often happened, and have always had the same final effect.</p>

<p>What clung to Marian&#8217;s soul was an immemorial prejudice
against a gipsy&#8217;s life and a stroller&#8217;s fate. Her ancestors and her
husband&#8217;s had always earned their livelihood in the honest ways
of a trade. She could not see what the free tuition at D&ouml;derlein&#8217;s
conservatory would avail Daniel, since he had nothing wherewithal
to sustain life. He told her that Spindler had taught him
how to play on the piano, that he would perfect his skill and so
earn his sustenance. She shook her head. Then he spoke to her
of the greatness of art, of the ecstasy which an artist could communicate
and the immortality he might win, and that perhaps it
would be granted him to create something unique and incomparable.
But these words she thought mad and pretentious delusions, and
smiled contemptuously. And at that his soul turned away from her,
and she seemed a mother to him no more.</p>

<p>When Jason Philip Schimmelweis learned what was afoot, he
would not let the troublesome journey deter him, but appeared in
Marian&#8217;s shop like an avenging angel. Daniel feared him no
longer, since he had given up hoping for anything from him. He
laughed to himself at the sight of the stubby, short-necked man in
his rage. Gleams of mockery and of cunning still played over the
red cheeks of Jason Philip, for he had a very high opinion of
himself, and did not think the windy follies of a boy of nineteen
worthy of the whole weight of his personality.</p>

<p>While he talked his little eyes sparkled, and his red, little tongue
pushed away the recalcitrant hairs of his moustache from his
voluble lips. Daniel stood by the door, leaning against the post,
his arms folded across his chest, and regarded now his mother, who,
dumb and suddenly old, sat in a corner of the sofa, now the oil
portrait of his father on the opposite wall. A friend of Gottfried
Nothafft&#8217;s youth, a painter who had been long lost and forgotten
like his other works, had once painted it. It showed a man of
serious bearing, and brought to mind the princely guildsman of
the Middle Ages. Seeing the picture at that moment enlightened
Daniel as to the ancestral strain that had brought him to this mood
and to this hour.</p>

<p>And turning now once more to Jason Philip&#8217;s face, he thought he
perceived in it the restlessness of an evil conscience. It seemed to
him that this man was not acting from conviction but from an
antecedent determination. It seemed to him further that he was
faced, not merely by this one man and his rage and its accidental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>causes, but by a whole world in arms that was pledged to enmity
against him. He had no inclination now to await the end of Jason
Philip&#8217;s oratorical efforts, and left the room.</p>

<p>Jason Philip grew pale. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let us deceive ourselves,
Marian,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have nursed a viper on your bosom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel stood by the Wolfram fountain in the square, and let the
purple of the setting sun shine upon him. Round about him the
stones and the beams of the ancient houses glowed, and the maids
who came with pails to fetch water at the fountain gazed with
astonishment into the brimming radiance of the sky. At this hour
his native town grew very dear to Daniel. When Jason Philip
entered the square, at the corner of which the stage-coach was
waiting, he did his best not to be seen by Daniel and avoided him
in a wide semi-circle. But Daniel turned around and fastened
his eyes on the man, who strode rapidly and gazed stubbornly
aside.</p>

<p>This thing too has happened before and will happen again. Nor
is it amazing that the fugitive should turn and inspire terror in
his pursuer.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Daniel saw that he could not stay to be a burden to his mother
with her small resources. She was poor and dependent on the
judgment of a tyrannical kinsman. Mastering his passionate impulses,
he forced himself to cool reflection and made a plan. He
would have to work and earn so much money that after a year
or more he would be able to go to Andreas D&ouml;derlein and remind
him of his magnanimous offer. So he studied the advertisements
in the papers and wrote letters of application. A printer in Mannheim
wanted an assistant correspondent. Since he agreed to take
the small wage offered, he was summoned to that city. Marian
gave him his railway fare.</p>

<p>He endured the torment for three months. Then it grew unbearable.
For seven months he slaved for an architect in Stuttgart,
next four months for the municipal bath in Baden-Baden, finally
for six weeks in a cigarette factory in Kaiserslautern.</p>

<p>He lived like a dog. In terror of having to spend money, he
avoided all human intercourse. He was unspeakably lonely.
Hunger and self-denial made him as lean as a rope. His cheeks
grew hollow, his limbs trembled in their sockets. He patched
his own clothes, and to save his shoes hammered curved bits of iron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>to the heels and toes. His aim sustained him; Andreas D&ouml;derlein
beckoned in the distance.</p>

<p>Every night he counted the sum he had saved so far. And
when at last, after sixteen months of self-denial, he had a fortune
of two hundred marks, he thought he could risk the fateful step.
As he reckoned and according to his present standard of life, he
thought that this money would last him five months. Within
that period new sources might open. He had come to know many
people and had experienced many circumstances, but in reality he
had known no one and experienced nothing, for he had stood in
the world like a lantern with a covered light. With an enormous
expenditure of energy he had restrained his mind from its native
activity. He had throttled it for the sake of its future. Hence
his whole soul had now the temperature of a blast furnace.</p>

<p>On his trip his fare was the accustomed one of dry bread and
cheese. He had made a package of his few books and his music,
and had despatched it in care of the railway station in Nuremberg.
It was early spring. In fair weather he slept in the open. When
it rained he took refuge in barns. A little bundle was his pillow
and his ragged top-coat shielded him from frost. Not rarely
farmers received him in kindly fashion and gave him a meal.
Now and then a tramping apprentice joined him. But his silence
did not invite companionship.</p>

<p>Once in the neighbourhood of Kitzingen he came upon a high
fenced park. Under a maple tree in the park sat a young girl in
a white dress reading a book. A voice called: &#8220;Sylvia!&#8221; Thereupon
the girl arose, and with unforgettable grace of movement
walked deeper into the garden.</p>

<p>And Daniel thought: Sylvia! A sound as though from a better
world. He shuddered. Was it to be his lot to stand without
a gate of life that gave everything to the eyes and nothing to the
hands?</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>He sought out Andreas D&ouml;derlein at once. He was told that the
professor was not in town. Two weeks later he stood once more
before the old house. He was told that the professor could not be
seen to-day. He was discouraged. But out of loyalty to his
cause he returned at the end of three days and was received.</p>

<p>He entered an overheated room. The professor was sitting in
an arm chair. On his knees was his little, eight-year-old daughter;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>in his right arm he held a large doll. The white tiles of the
stove were adorned with pictured scenes from the Nibelungen
legend; table and chairs were littered with music scores; the
windows had leaded panes; in one corner there was a mass of artfully
grouped objects&mdash;peacocks&#8217; feathers, gay-coloured silks,
Chinese fans. This combination was known as a Makart bouquet,
and represented the taste of the period.</p>

<p>D&ouml;derlein put the little girl down and gave her her doll. Then
he drew himself up to the fulness of his gigantic stature, a process
that gave him obvious pleasure. His neck was so fat that his chin
seemed to rest on a gelatinous mass.</p>

<p>He seemed not to recall Daniel. Cues had to be given him to
distinguish this among his crowded memories. He snapped his
fingers. It was a sign that his mind had reached the desired place.
&#8220;Ah, yes, yes, yes! To be sure, to be sure, my dear young man!
But what do you suppose? Just now when all available space is
as crowded as a street strewn with crumbs is crowded with sparrows.
We might take the matter up again in autumn. Yes, in autumn
something might be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>A pause, during which the great man gave inarticulate sounds of
profound regret. And was the young man, after all, so sure of a
genuine talent? Had he considered that art was becoming more
and more an idling place for the immature and the shipwrecked?
It was so difficult to tell the sheep from the goats. And finally,
granting talent, how was the young man equipped in the matter
of moral energy? There, indisputably, the core of the problem
was to be sought. Or didn&#8217;t he, perhaps, think so?</p>

<p>As through a fog Daniel observed that the little girl had approached
him and looked him over with a curiously cold and
testing glance. Almost he was impelled to stretch out his hand
and cover the eyes of the child, whose manner was uncanny to him
through some ghostly presentiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m truly sorry that I can&#8217;t give you a more encouraging outlook.&#8221;
Andreas D&ouml;derlein&#8217;s voice was oily, and showed a conscious
delight in its own sound. &#8220;But as I said, there&#8217;s nothing to be
done until autumn. Suppose you leave me your address. Put it
down on this slip. No? Well, quite as you wish. Good-bye,
young man, good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>D&ouml;derlein accompanied him to the door. Then he returned
to his daughter, took her on his knee, picked up the doll, and said:
&#8220;Human beings, my dear Dorothea, are a wretched set. If I were
to compare them to sparrows on the road, I should be doing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>sparrows but little honour. Heavens and earth! Wouldn&#8217;t even
write his name on a slip of paper. Felt hurt! Well, well, well.
What funny creatures men are. Wouldn&#8217;t leave his name. Well,
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hummed the Walhalla motif, and Dorothea, bending over
her doll, coquettishly kissed the waxen face.</p>

<p>Daniel, standing in front of the house, bit his lips like a man
in a fever who does not want his teeth to rattle. Why, the depth
of his soul asked him, why did you sit in their counting-houses and
waste their time? Why did you crucify your body and bind my
wings? Why were you deaf to me and desirous of gathering
fruits where there are only stones? Why did you, like a coward,
flee from your fate to their offices and ware-houses and iron safes
and all their doleful business? For the sake of this hour? Poor
fool!</p>

<p>And he answered: &#8220;Never again, my soul, never again.&#8221;</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>In the beginning Marian had received a letter from Daniel
every now and then. These letters became rarer. During the
second year he wrote only once&mdash;a few lines at Christmas.</p>

<p>At the time when he was leaving his last place of employment
he wrote her on a postcard that he was changing his residence again.
But he did not tell her that he was going to Nuremberg. So spring
passed and summer. Then her soul, which was wavering between
fear and hope, was rudely jolted out of its dim state by a letter
from Jason Philip.</p>

<p>He wrote that Daniel was loafing about in Nuremberg. Quite by
accident he had met him a few days before near the fair booths
on Sch&uuml;tt Island. His appearance was indescribable. He had
tried to question him, but Daniel had disappeared. What had
brought him to the city he, Jason Philip, could not see. But he
was willing to wager that at the bottom of it was some shady trick,
for the fellow had not looked like one who earns an honest living.
So he proposed to Marian that she should come to Nuremberg and
help in a raid on the vagabond, in order to prevent the unblemished
name he bore from being permanently disgraced before it was too
late. As a contribution to her travelling expenses he enclosed five
marks in stamps.</p>

<p>Marian had received the letter at noon. She had at once locked
up her house and shop. At two o&#8217;clock she had reached the station
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>at Ansbach; at four she arrived in Nuremberg. Carrying
her hand-bag, she asked her way to Plobenhof Street at every
corner.</p>

<p>Theresa sat at the cashier&#8217;s desk. Her brown hair on her square
peasant&#8217;s skull was smoothly combed. Zwanziger, the freckled
shop-assistant, was busy unpacking books. Theresa greeted her sister
with apparent friendliness, but she did not leave her place. She
stretched out her hand across the ink-stand, and observed Marian&#8217;s
shabby appearance&mdash;the worn shawl, the old-fashioned little cloth
bonnet with its black velvet ribbands meeting in a bow under the
chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go upstairs for a bit,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and let the children entertain
you. Rieke will bring up your bag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your husband?&#8221; asked Marian.</p>

<p>&#8220;At an electors&#8217; meeting,&#8221; Theresa answered morosely. &#8220;They
couldn&#8217;t meet properly, according to him, if he isn&#8217;t there.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment a man in a workingman&#8217;s blouse entered the
shop and began to talk to Theresa urgently in a soft but excited
voice. &#8220;I bought the set of books and they&#8217;re my property,&#8221; said
the man. &#8220;Suppose I did skip a payment. That&#8217;s no reason to
lose my property. I call that sharp practice, Frau Schimmelweis,
that&#8217;s what I call it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Herr Wachsmuth buy of us?&#8221; Theresa turned to the
shop-assistant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Schlosser&#8217;s &#8216;History of the World,&#8217;&#8221; was the prompt answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better read your contract,&#8221; Theresa said to the workingman.
&#8220;The terms are all fixed there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s sharp practice, Frau Schimmelweis, sharp practice,&#8221; the
man repeated, as though this phrase summed up all he could express
in the way of withering condemnation. &#8220;A fellow like me
wants to get on and wants to learn something. All right. So I
think I&#8217;ll buy me a book and get a step ahead in knowledge. So
where do I go? To a party member, to Comrade Schimmelweis,
thinking natural-like I&#8217;m safe in his hands. I pay sixty marks&mdash;hard
earned money&mdash;for a history of the world, and manage to
squeeze the payments out o&#8217; my wages, and then, all of a sudden,
when half the price is paid, I&#8217;m to have my property taken from me
without so much as a by your leave just because I&#8217;m two payments in
arrears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Read your contract,&#8221; said Theresa. &#8220;Every point is stipulated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder people get rich,&#8221; the man went on. His voice grew
louder and louder, and he glanced angrily at Jason Philip, who at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>that moment rushed into the shop with his hat crushed and his
trousers sprinkled with mud. &#8220;No wonder that people can buy
houses and speculate in real estate. Yes, Schimmelweis, I call such
things sharp practice, and I don&#8217;t give a damn for your contract.
Everybody knows by this time what kind of business is done here&mdash;more
like a man-trap&mdash;and that these here instalments are just a
scheme to squeeze the workingman dry. First you talk to him
about education, and then you suck his blood. It&#8217;s hell!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull yourself together, Wachsmuth!&#8221; Jason Philip cried sternly.</p>

<p>Wachsmuth picked up his cap, and slammed the shopdoor behind
him.</p>

<p>Marian Nothafft&#8217;s eyes passed mechanically over the titles of
a row of fiercely red pamphlets spread out on a table. She read:
&#8220;The Battle that Decides,&#8221; &#8220;Modern Slaveholders,&#8221; &#8220;The Rights
of the Poor,&#8221; &#8220;Christianity and Capitalism,&#8221; &#8220;The Crimes of the
Bourgeoisie.&#8221; Although these catch-words meant nothing to her,
she felt in her heart once more her old, long forgotten hatred
against machines.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>&#8220;Fetch me a sandwich, Theresa,&#8221; Jason Philip commanded, &#8220;I&#8217;m
hungry as a wolf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you eat anything at the inn?&#8221; Theresa asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was at no such place.&#8221; Jason Philip&#8217;s eyes gleamed, and he
shook his head like a lion.</p>

<p>So Theresa went to fetch his sandwich. It was queer to observe
how much distrust and contradiction she was able to express through
the sloth of her movements. But her daughter Philippina was already
hurrying down the stairs with the sandwich.</p>

<p>At this moment Jason Philip became aware of his sister-in-law.
&#8220;Ah, there you are, you shrinking flower,&#8221; he said lightly, and
held out his pudgy hand. &#8220;Theresa will put you up in the little
room under the store-room. You have a pleasant view of the river
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Theresa handed him the bread. He sniffed at it, and frowned
because it wasn&#8217;t thickly enough buttered. But he had not the
courage to complain. He bit into it, and, with full cheeks, turned
once more to Marian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that son of yours has disappeared again. A nice situation.
Shouldn&#8217;t wonder if he ended in the penitentiary. The best
thing would be to ship him off to America; but it isn&#8217;t clear to me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>how we&#8217;re to get hold of him at all. It was really premature to
ask you to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If only I knew what he&#8217;s living on,&#8221; Marian whispered, with
repressed anguish.</p>

<p>Jason Philip indulged with broad psychical comfort in an
anecdote: &#8220;I was reading the other day how a giraffe escaped from
the Zoo. You&#8217;ve heard of giraffes. They are long-necked quadrupeds,
very stupid and stubborn. The silly beast had run off into
the woods, and the people didn&#8217;t know how to capture it. Then
the keeper hung the stable-lantern over his chest and a bundle of
hay on his back, and at nightfall went into the woods. Scarcely
had the giraffe noticed the gleam of the lantern when it came up
in its curiosity. At once the man swung around. It smelled the
hay, nibbled, and began to feed. Slowly the man went on, and
the beast went on nibbling and feeding. First thing you know
it was back in its cage. Now don&#8217;t you think that when hunger
begins to torment him, your Daniel could be tamed with a bit
of hay too? It&#8217;s worth your thinking about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jason Philip laughed merrily, and Zwanziger grinned. His boss
was a source of humour. At night, when he sat in his favourite
tap-rooms over his beer, he would entertain his boon companions
with the witticisms of Schimmelweis, and always won their applause.</p>

<p>A lean old man with kid gloves and a top-hat entered the shop.
It was growing dark, and he had peered carefully about before
entering. He hurried up to Jason Philip, and said in a cracked
falsetto: &#8220;How about the new publications? Anything very fine?&#8221;
He rubbed his hands, and stared stupidly from under his thin, reddish
lids. It was Count Schlemm-Nottheim, a cousin of the Baron
von Auffenberg, the leader of the liberal party.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m entirely at your service, sir,&#8221; said Jason Philip, holding
himself as rigidly as a sergeant who is being addressed by a captain.</p>

<p>He led the count to a corner of the shop, and opened a heavy
oaken chest. This chest contained the pornographic publications
forbidden by the state. They were sold quite secretly and only
to very reliable persons.</p>

<p>Jason Philip whispered, and the old count turned over the heap
of books with avid fingers.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Marian climbed up the steep, dark stairs, and rang the upstairs
bell. She had to tell the maid who she was and even mention her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>name to the children. The latter laughed at her stiff, rural courtesy.
Philippina, who was twelve, acted arrogantly and swung her
hips when she walked. All three had their mother&#8217;s square head
and a cheesy complexion.</p>

<p>The maid brought up the bag. Then Theresa came too and
helped her sister unpack. With her acrid, unfeeling voice she asked
many questions, but without waiting for an answer told the tale of
marriage and births and deaths that had taken place in the city.
She avoided Marian&#8217;s eyes, because she was silently considering how
long her sister&#8217;s visit would last and to what expense it would put
her.</p>

<p>She did not mention Daniel, and her silence condemned him
more completely than her husband&#8217;s acrimonious speeches. She
held firmly an almost religious doctrine of the complete obedience
which children owe their parents, and doubted Marian&#8217;s power to
punish properly a breach of this sacred law.</p>

<p>When Marian was left alone, she sat down by the window of
the little room, and gazed sadly down at the river. Without any
curl of waves the yellow water glided by and washed the walls
of the houses on the other bank. She had a view of the Museum
Bridge and another bridge, and the crowding of people on the
bridges disquieted her.</p>

<p>She walked through the streets, and stopped at the head of the
Museum Bridge. She thought that every human being who lived
in the town must pass by here sooner or later. Her attentive
glance searched all faces, and where one escaped, she followed the
figure as it melted into the dark. But as it grew later the people
were fewer and fewer.</p>

<p>At night she would lie awake, and listen to the dull echo of the
feet of the last passerby. Next day from morning to twilight she
would wander up and down the streets. What she saw weighed on
her heart. The city people seemed to her like dumb animals,
tormented and angry. The narrow streets stopped her breath; the
hubbub deadened her senses.</p>

<p>But she was never tired of seeking.</p>

<p>On the fifth day she did not come home until ten o&#8217;clock.
Theresa, who had gone to bed, sent her a plate of lentil soup.
While she was avidly eating the soup she heard steps in the hall and
a knock at the door. Jason Philip entered. &#8220;Come along at once,&#8221;
was all he said. But she understood. With trembling fingers she
threw a shawl across her shoulders, since the October nights were
growing cool, and followed him in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p><p>They went up hill to Adler Street, turned into it and then into a
narrow, dark little alley at the right. A lantern hung above a
door and on a green glass pane were inscribed the words: &#8220;The
Vale of Tears.&#8221; A greenish light suffused the stone stairs that led
to the cellar, the kegs and the desolate room filled with chairs and
benches. A sourish smell of wine arose from the place.</p>

<p>Beside the entrance there was a barred window. Beside it Jason
Philip stopped, and beckoned Marian to join him.</p>

<p>At the long tables below them sat a queer crowd. They were
young men, but such as one never finds in ordinary houses and only
very rarely in the streets. Want seemed to have driven them to
huddle here, and the night to have lured them from their hiding
places&mdash;shipwrecked creatures they seemed who had fled to a cavern
on some deserted shore. They had absurdly gay cravats and sad,
pallid faces, and the greenish light made them look altogether like
corpses. It was long since a barber had touched their hair or a
tailor their garb.</p>

<p>A little aside from these sat two old fellows, habitual topers,
not in the best circumstances themselves, yet rather astonished at
this dreary Stygian crew. For they themselves at least received
their weekly wage of a Saturday night, while those others had
obviously for years not worked at all.</p>

<p>But in a dusky corner sat one at a piano and struck the keys with
a strange might. He had no score before him, but played from
memory. The instrument moaned; the strings hummed pitifully;
the pedals creaked; but the man who played was so bewitched by
his music that he cared little for the inadequacy of its communication.
Wild as the tumult of the playing sounded, the shrill and
raging chords, the wild clamour of the treble, the driven triplets
and seething tremolos of the bass, yet the deep emotion of the
player, the ecstasy and world-estranged madness in which he was,
lent the scene a melancholy and a solemnity which would have had
its effect even without the greenish cellar and the cavernous pallor
of the listeners.</p>

<p>Marian had at once recognised the pianist as Daniel. She had
to hold fast to the bars of the window and lean her knees against
the wainscoting. It was not for nothing that Jason Philip was
known as a thorough wag. The comparison to Daniel in the lion&#8217;s
den was too much for him. He whispered the words to Marian.
But since the window was open and the music had first risen and
then, at this moment, paused, his words penetrated to the people
below, and several heads turned toward him. Marian was thoughtless.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>She believed that the piece had ended. Faintly and fearfully
she cried: &#8220;Daniel!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel leaped up, stared at her, saw Jason Philip&#8217;s mocking face,
hastened to the door, the steps, and was beside them.</p>

<p>He stood in the doorway, and his lips began to form words.
The unhappy boy, she thought, and it seemed to her as though
power would be given her to press back to his heart the words she
trembled to hear.</p>

<p>It was in vain. The words were uttered. He did not wish to
see his mother any more; he was content to live alone and for himself
and to be free. He needed no one. He needed only to
be free.</p>

<p>Jason Philip hurled a glance of contempt at the blasphemous
wretch, and drew Marian away with him. To the very corner of
the alley they were accompanied by the excited voices of the
people in the Vale of Tears.</p>

<p>Next morning Marian returned to Eschenbach.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span><a name="FOES_BROTHERS_A_FRIEND_AND_A_MASK" id="FOES_BROTHERS_A_FRIEND_AND_A_MASK"></a>FOES, BROTHERS, A FRIEND AND A MASK</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Daniel</span> had rented a room of the brush-maker Hadebusch and
his wife, who lived on Jacob&#8217;s Square behind the church.</p>

<p>It was March, and a sudden cold had set in; and Frau Hadebusch
had a superstitious fear of coal, which she characterised as Devil&#8217;s
dung. At the back of the yard was the wood pile, and logs were
brought in with which to feed the oven fires. But wood was dear,
and had Daniel fed his little iron stove in the garret with such
costly food, his monthly bill would have reached a fabulous height.
He paid seven marks a month for his room and counted every
penny so as not to shorten the period of his liberty by any needless
expenditure.</p>

<p>So he sat freezing over his books and scores until the first warmth
of spring stole in through the windows. The books he borrowed
from the library at the King&#8217;s Gate, and paid six pfennigs a
volume. Achim von Arnim and Jean Paul were his guides in those
days: the one adorned the world of the senses for him, the other
that of the soul.</p>

<p>On the police department&#8217;s identification blank Daniel had called
himself a musician. Frau Hadebusch brought the paper into her
living room, which, like all the rooms of the house, seemed built
for dwarfs and reeked of limewater and lye. It was at the day&#8217;s
end, and in the room were assembled Herr Francke and Herr
Benjamin Dorn, who lodged on the second floor, and Frau Hadebusch&#8217;s
son, who was weak-minded and crouched grinning beside
the stove.</p>

<p>Herr Francke was a town traveller for a cigar house, and was
regarded as a good deal of a Don Juan by the female servants of
the neighbourhood. Benjamin Dorn was a clerk in the Prudentia
Life Insurance Company, belonged to a Methodist congregation, and
was respected by all the respectable on account of his Christian walk
and conversation.</p>

<p>These gentlemen examined the document thoroughly and with
frowns. Herr Francke gave it as his opinion that a musician who
never made music could scarcely be regarded as one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;He&#8217;s probably pawned his bass violin or bugle or whatever he
was taught,&#8221; he said contemptuously; &#8220;perhaps he can only beat
a drum. Well, I can do that too if I have one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ve got to have a drum to be a drummer,&#8221; Benjamin
Dorn remarked. &#8220;The question, however, is whether such a calling
is in harmony with the principles of Christian modesty.&#8221; He
laid his finger on his nose, and added: &#8220;It is a question which, with
all proper humility, all proper humility, you understand, I would
answer in the negative.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t any relatives and no acquaintances at all,&#8221; Frau
Hadebusch wailed, and her voice sounded like the scraping of
carrots on a grater; &#8220;and no employment and no prospects and no
boots or clothes but what he&#8217;s got on. In all my life I haven&#8217;t
had no such lodger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The blank fluttered to the floor, whence the weak-minded Hadebusch
Jr. picked it up, rolled it in the shape of a bag, and applied
that bag, trumpet-like, to his lips, a procedure which caused the
document in question to be gradually soaked through and thus
withdrawn from its official uses. Frau Hadebusch was too little
concerned over the police regulations to take further thought of
her duties as the keeper of a lodging house.</p>

<p>Herr Francke drew from his pocket a pack of greasy cards and
began to shuffle them. Frau Hadebusch giggled and it sounded like
a witch rustling in the fire. The Methodist conquered his pious
scruples, and placed his pfennigs on the table; the town-traveller
turned up his sleeves as though he were about to wring a hen&#8217;s
neck.</p>

<p>Before very long there arose a dissonant controversy, since Herr
Francke&#8217;s relations with the goddess of fortune were strained and
violent. The old brush-maker poked his head in at the door and
cursed; the weak-minded boy blew dreamily on his paper trumpet;
and the company that had been so peacefully at one separated in
violence and rage.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Daniel wandered up to the castle, along the walls, over the
bridges and planks.</p>

<p>It was his youth that caused him so to love the night that he
forgot all men and seemed to himself to be alone on earth. It was
his youth that delivered him up to things with such passion that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>he was able to weave the ghostly flowers of melodies about all
that is visible&mdash;melodies that were so delicate, so eloquent, and so
winged that no pen could ever record them. They vanished and
died whenever he sought to capture them.</p>

<p>But it was also his youth that fired his eyes with hatred when
he saw the comfort of lit windows, and filled his heart with bitterness
against the satisfied, the indifferent, the strangers, the eternal
strangers who had no consciousness of him.</p>

<p>He was so small and so great: small in the eyes of the world,
great in his own estimation. When the tones burst from him like
sparks from an anvil, he was a god. When he stood in the dark
court behind the City Theatre waiting for the final chorus of
&#8220;Fidelio&#8221; to penetrate the wall and reach his grateful ears, he was
an outcast. Fountains of music rustled all about him. He looked
into the eyes of the children and there was melody; he gazed up at
the stars and there was harmony. He finally came to the point
where there was no limit. His day was a waste place, his brain
a parched field in the rain, his thoughts were birds of passage, his
dreams a super-life.</p>

<p>He lived on bread and fruit, treating himself only every third
day to a warm meal in the inn at the sign of the White Tower.
There he would sit and listen at times, unobserved, to the quite
remarkable conversation of some young fellows. This awakened
in him a longing for intercourse with congenial companions. But
when the brethren of the Vale of Tears finally took him into
their circle, he was like a Robinson Crusoe or a Selkirk who had
been abducted from his island.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Benjamin Dorn was a compassionate individual. The desire to
save a lost soul filled him with the courage to pay Daniel Nothafft
a visit. He hobbled up the creaky steps with his club-foot, and
knocked timidly at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I be of service to you, Sir, in a Christian way?&#8221; he asked,
after he had blown his nose.</p>

<p>Daniel looked at him in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, I could help you in an unselfish, Christian way,
to get a position. There is a great deal of work to be done down
at the Prudentia. If I were to recommend you to Herr Zittel
it certainly would not be in vain. Herr Zittel is head of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>clerical department. I also stand in with Herr Diruf, and he is
general agent. I come in contact nearly every day with Inspector
Jordan, and Herr Jordan is a man of exceptional culture. His
daughter Gertrude attended my Sunday-school class. She has
received and still enjoys divine favour. If you were to entrust
your case to me, you would be entering upon a righteous, wholesome
career. I am always looking out for some one. To tell the
truth, and not wishing to appear immodest, I was born that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man looked like a patchwork of qualmishness, tribulation,
and unctuous piety, and his coat collar was badly frayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; replied Daniel; &#8220;don&#8217;t you see that I am
getting along quite well?&#8221;</p>

<p>The pious life-insurance agent sighed and brushed a drop from
the tip of his nose with the back of his hand. &#8220;My dear Sir,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;take to heart the words of Solomon: Pride goeth before
a fall, but the humble in spirit obtain honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll take that to heart,&#8221; said Daniel drily, and bent still
lower over the score on which he was working.</p>

<p>Benjamin Dorn sighed again, and limped out of the room.
With his thumbs pointing straight to high heaven above, he said to
Frau Hadebusch: &#8220;You know, Frau Hadebusch, I simply can&#8217;t help
it. I must lighten my heart in a Christian way. What do you
think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens, what&#8217;s he doing? What&#8217;s he up to now?&#8221;
sighed the old lady, as she shoved her broom under her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;As true as I stand here, the table is all covered with papers,
and the papers are all covered with some kind of mysterious
signs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alarmed at the very thought of having a lodger up in the attic
who was practising black magic, Frau Hadebusch sent her husband
down to the district policeman. This enlightened official declared
that the brush-maker was a gossip. Vexed at this unanticipated
description of himself, the brush-maker went straightway to the
inn at the sign of the Horse and got drunk, so drunk that Benjamin
Dorn had to take him home. It was a beautiful moonlit
night.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Not far from Hadebusch&#8217;s was a little caf&eacute; known as The Paradise.
Everything in it was diminutive, the proprietor, the waitress,
the tables, the chairs and the portions. There the brethren from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>the Vale of Tears assembled to drag the gods down into the dust
and destroy the universe in general.</p>

<p>Daniel wended his way thither. He knew the liliputian
room and the starved faces. He was personally acquainted with
the painter who never painted, the writer who never wrote, the
student who never studied, and the inventor who never invented
anything. He knew all about the sculptor who squandered such
talents as he may have had in tinkering with plaster casts, the
actor who had been on a leave of absence for years, and the half
dozen mendicant Philistines who came here day after day to have
a good time in their own repelling fashion. He knew the young
Baron von Auffenberg who had broken with his family for reasons
that were clear to no one but himself. He knew Herr Carovius,
who invariably played the r&ocirc;le of the observer, and who sat there
in a sort of mysterious fashion, smiling to himself a smile of languishing
irony, and stroking his hand over his long hair, which
was cut straight across at the back of his neck.</p>

<p>He knew, ah, he knew by heart, the grease spots on the walls
that had been rubbed in by the heads of the habitu&eacute;s, the indelible
splotches on the tables, the hartshorn buttons on the proprietor&#8217;s
vest, and the smoke-coloured curtains draped about the tiny windows.
The loud, boisterous talking, the daily repetition of the
same hackneyed remarks, the anarchistic swashbuckling of the
painter whom his comrades had dubbed Kropotkin&mdash;all of these
were familiar stories to him. He knew the philosophic cynicism
of the student who felt that he was the Socrates of the nineteenth
century, and who looked back on twenty-five wasted semesters as
on so many battles fought and won.</p>

<p>The most interesting personage was Herr Carovius. He was a
well-read man. That he knew a great deal about music was plain
from many of his chance remarks. He was a brother-in-law of
Andreas D&ouml;derlein, though he seemed to take anything but pride
in the relationship. If any one mentioned D&ouml;derlein&#8217;s name in his
presence, he screwed up his face, and began to shuffle about uneasily
on his chair. He was an unfathomable, impenetrable personality.
Even if his years&mdash;he was forty-five&mdash;had not won for him a
measure of esteem, the malicious and mordant scorn he heaped on
his fellow-men would have done so. People said he had a good
deal of money. If this was brought to his attention, he employed
the most ghastly oaths in asserting his poverty. But since he had
neither calling nor profession and spent his days in unqualified
idleness, it was apparent that his assertions on this point were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>wholly unfounded, and this despite the virility of his unconventional
language.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, tell me, who is that lanky quack there?&#8221; asked Herr
Carovius, pointing to Daniel and looking at Schwalbe the sculptor.
He had known Daniel for a long while, but every now and then
it gave him a peculiar kind of pleasure to play the r&ocirc;le of the
newcomer.</p>

<p>The sculptor looked at him indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a man who still has faith in himself,&#8221; he remarked
rather morosely. &#8220;He is a man who has bathed in the dragon
blood of illusions, and has become as invulnerable as Young Siegfried.
He is convinced that the people who sleep in the houses
around this part of town dream of his future greatness, and have
already placed an order with the green-grocer for his laurel wreath.
He has not the faintest idea that the only thing that is sacred to
them is their midday meal, that they are ready to drink their beer
at the first stroke of the gong, and to yawn when the light appears
on Mount Sinai. He is completely taken up with himself; he is
sufficient unto himself; and he gathers honey. The bee will have
its honey, and if it is unable to get it from the flowers, it buzzes
about the dung heap. As is evidently the case here. <i>Prosit</i>
Nothafft,&#8221; he said in conclusion, and lifted his glass to Daniel.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius smiled in his usual languishing fashion. &#8220;Nothafft,&#8221;
he bleated, &#8220;Nothafft, Nothafft, that is a fine name, but
not exactly one that is predestined to a niche in Walhalla. It
strikes me as being rather more appropriate for the sign of a tailor.
Good Lord! The bones the young people gnaw at to-day were
covered with meat in my time.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, clasping his glasses a bit firmer onto his nose, he
riveted his blinking, squinting eyes on the door. Eberhard von
Auffenberg, elegant, slender, and disgruntled, entered to find life
where others were throwing it away.</p>

<p>It was far into the night when the brethren went home. As they
passed along through the streets they bellowed their nocturnal
serenades at the windows of the otherwise peaceful houses.</p>

<p>As the hilarious laughter and vocal rowdyism reached Daniel&#8217;s
ear, he detected from out of the hubbub a gentle voice in E-flat
minor, accompanied by the inexorable eighth-notes sung with
impressive vigour. Then the voice died away in a solemn E-flat
major chord, and everything was as if sunk in the bottom of
the sea.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p><h3>V</h3>

<p>Toward the end of the summer, Philippina, Jason Philip&#8217;s
daughter, shot out the eye of her seven-year-old brother with a
so-called bean-shooter.</p>

<p>The children were playing in the yard. Willibald, the older
boy, wanted the shooter. Philippina, who had not the slightest
sense of humour, snatched it from his hands, placed the stone on
the elastic band and let it fly with all her might. Little Marcus
ran in front of it. It was all over in a jiffy. A heart-rending
scream caused the frightened mother to leave the shop and run
out into the yard. She found the child lying on the ground convulsed
with pain. While Theresa carried the boy into the house,
Jason Philip ran for the doctor. But it was too late; the eye
was lost.</p>

<p>Philippina hid. After considerable search her father found her
under the cellar steps. He beat her so mercilessly that the neighbours
had to come up and take him away.</p>

<p>Little Marcus was Theresa&#8217;s favourite child. She could not
get over the accident. The obsession that had slumbered in her
soul for years now became more persistent than ever: she began
to brood over guilt in general and this case in particular.</p>

<p>At times she would get up in the night, light a candle, and
walk about the house in her stocking feet. She would look behind
the stove and under the table, and then crouch down with her ear
against the maid&#8217;s door. She would examine the mouse-trap and
if a mouse had been caught in it, she could not, try as she might,
completely detach her own unrest from the mental disturbance of
the little beast.</p>

<p>One day Jason Philip was stopped on the street by a well-known
cabinet-maker and asked whether he had any old furniture
for sale. Jason Philip replied that he was not at all familiar with
the contents of the attic and sent him to Theresa. Theresa recalled
that there was an old desk up in the attic that had been standing
there for years. She suggested that they might be willing to
dispose of this for a few taler, and accompanied the man to the
room where the worn-out furniture was stored.</p>

<p>She opened the little wooden door. The cabinet-maker caught
sight at once of the desk. It had only three legs and was just
about ready to fall to pieces. &#8220;I can&#8217;t make you an offer for
that,&#8221; said the cabinet-maker, and began to rap on it here and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>there, somewhat as a physician might sound a corpse. &#8220;The most
I can offer you is twelve groschen.&#8221;</p>

<p>They haggled for a while, and finally agreed on sixteen. The
man left at once, having promised to send one of his men up in
the afternoon to get the desk. Theresa was already standing on
the steps, when it occurred to her that it might be well to go
through the drawers before letting the thing get out of the house:
there might be some old documents in them. She went back up in
the attic.</p>

<p>In the dust of one of the drawers she found, sure enough, a
bundle of papers, and among them the receipt which Gottfried
Nothafft had sent back to Jason Philip ten years before. She read
in the indistinct light the confidential words of the deceased. She
saw that Jason Philip had received three thousand taler.</p>

<p>After she had read this, she crumpled up the paper. Then she
put it into her apron pocket and screamed out: &#8220;Be gone, Gottfried,
be gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>She went down stairs into the kitchen. There she took her
place by the table and stirred a mixture of flour and eggs, as completely
absent-minded as it is possible for one to become who
spends her time in that part of the house. Rieke, the maid, became
so alarmed at her behaviour that she made the sign of the cross.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>When the midday meal was over, the children left the table
and prepared to go to school. Jason Philip lighted a cigar, and
took the newspaper from his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you find anything for the second-hand furniture man?&#8221;
he asked, as he puffed away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found something for him and something for myself,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? You found something for yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I mean? I mean just what I said. I have always
known that there was something crooked about that money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What money are you talking about? Listen, don&#8217;t speak to
me in riddles! When you have anything to say to me, say it.
Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean Gottfried Nothafft&#8217;s money, Jason Philip,&#8221; said
Theresa, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>Jason Philip bent over the table. &#8220;Then you have at last
found the old receipt, have you?&#8221; he asked with wide-opened eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>&#8220;Ahem! You have found the receipt that I&#8217;ve been looking for
for years&nbsp;...?&#8221;</p>

<p>Theresa nodded. She took out a hairpin, and stuck it in a
crust of bread. Jason Philip got up, clasped his hands behind his
back, and began to walk back and forth. Just then Rieke came in
and began to clear off the table. She went about her business in
a slow but noisy fashion. She made things rattle, even if she
could not make them hum. When she was through, Jason Philip,
his hands pressed to his hips, his elbows protruding, planted himself
before Theresa.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you think I am going to let you browbeat me,&#8221; he
began. &#8220;Well, my dear woman, you&#8217;re mistaken. Listen! Are
you angry at me because I have created for you and your children
a dignified existence? Do you take it amiss of me for having
kept your sister from going to the poor-house? You act as though
I had won that much money at the county fair, or had squandered
an equal amount at the same place. The truth is, Gottfried Nothafft
entrusted me with three thousand taler. That&#8217;s what he
did; that&#8217;s the truth. It was his intention to keep the whole affair
from the chatter of women. And he willed that I should use
this hard-earned capital in a productive way, and not give it to the
culprit who would waste it in debauchery and worse if possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ill-gotten goods seldom prosper,&#8221; said Theresa, without looking
up. &#8220;Things may go along all right for ten years, and that seems
like a long time, but the vengeance of Heaven comes in the
eleventh, as it has already come in the case of little Marcus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Theresa&mdash;you&#8217;re talking like a mad woman,&#8221; said Jason Philip
at the top of his voice. With that he picked up a chair, and threw
it on the floor so violently that every cup, spoon, and plate in the
room shook.</p>

<p>Theresa turned her peasant face toward him without the shadow
of a trace of fear. He was a trifle alarmed: &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to be
responsible, if you can, for any misfortune that visits us in the
future.&#8221; She spoke these words with a deep voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I am a bandit?&#8221; said Jason Philip. &#8220;Do you
think I want to pocket the money? Don&#8217;t you think that I am
capable of anything better or higher than that? Or is ambition
of any sort quite beyond your powers of comprehension?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what ambitions do you have?&#8221; asked Theresa in a tone
of sullenness, her eyes in the meantime blinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; Jason Philip continued, as he sat down on the chair
he had so violently abused a minute before, and assumed the air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>of a teacher: &#8220;The culprit has got to submit, and that with good
grace. He has got to fall on his knees before me. And he&#8217;ll
come to it. I have made some inquiries; I am on his tracks; and
I know that he has just about reached the end of his rope. He&#8217;ll
come, depend upon it he&#8217;ll come around, and when he does he
will whine. Then I am going to take him into the business. In
this way we will see whether it is humanly possible to make a useful
man out of him. If I can, and if he sticks, I&#8217;ll call him into the
office, tell him the whole story, make everything as clear as day
to him, and then offer to take him in as a partner in the firm. You
have got to admit that he will be a made man if he becomes my
partner. He will have sense enough himself to see this, and as
sure as you are living, he will first kiss my hand and then eat
out of it for the kindness I have shown him. And once this has
all been put through, I will bind him to us more firmly than ever
by having him marry Philippina.&#8221;</p>

<p>A wry smile disfigured Theresa&#8217;s face. &#8220;I see, so, so,&#8221; she
said in a sing-song tone. &#8220;You will have him marry Philippina.
I take it that you feel that she will be hard to marry, and that the
man who does marry her will have his hands full. Well, that&#8217;s
not a bad idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In this way,&#8221; continued Jason Philip, without detecting the
scorn in Theresa&#8217;s words, &#8220;the account between the culprit and
myself will be settled. He will become a decent member of
society, the money will remain in the family, and Philippina
will be cared for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And suppose he does not come; suppose he does not fall on
his knees; suppose you have made a miscalculation. What then?&#8221;
Whether Jason Philip himself believed what he had said Theresa
could not determine. Nor had she the slightest desire to enlighten
herself on this point. She did not look him in the face, but
contented herself with letting her eyes rest on his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;there will be time then to change my plans,&#8221; said Jason
Philip, in a tone of peeved vexation. &#8220;Leave it to me. I have
turned the whole situation over in my mind; I have omitted not
the slightest detail. I know men, and I have never made a mistake
in judging them. <i>Mahlzeit!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he went out.</p>

<p>Theresa remained seated for a while, her arms folded across
her breast. Then she got up, and walked over to the door that
opened on to the court. Suddenly she stopped as if rooted to the
sill: she caught sight of Philippina, who was then sitting by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>window mending a pair of socks. On her face there was an expression
of na&iuml;vet&eacute; that may be harmless in itself, but it was enough
to arouse suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, why didn&#8217;t you go to school?&#8221;
asked Theresa uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t; I had a headache,&#8221; said Philippina curtly, and
broke the thread as she gave a hasty jerk at the needle. Her dishevelled
hair hung down over her forehead and quite concealed
her face.</p>

<p>Theresa was silent. Her gloom-laden eyes rested on the diligent
fingers of Philippina. It was easy to suspect that the girl had
heard everything Jason Philip had said, for he had such a loud
voice. She could have done this without going to the trouble of
listening at the door. Theresa was minded to give the girl a
talking-to; but she controlled herself, and quietly withdrew.</p>

<p>Philippina looked straight through her as she left. But she did
not interrupt her work, and in a short while she could be heard
humming a tune to herself. There was a challenge in her voice.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Daniel&#8217;s money was about at an end. The new sources on
which he had hoped to be able to draw were nowhere to be discovered.
He defiantly closed the doors against care; and when
fear showed its gloomy face, he shut up shop, and went out to
drown his sorrows with the brethren of the Vale of Tears.</p>

<p>Schwalbe, the sculptor, had made the acquaintance of Zingarella,
then engaged in singing lascivious couplets at the Academy, and
invited the fellows to join him.</p>

<p>The Academy was a theatre of the lowest description. Smoking
was, of course, permitted. When they arrived the performance
was over. People were still sitting at many of the tables. Reeking
as the auditorium was with the stench of stale beer, it left the
impression of a dark, dank cavern.</p>

<p>With an indifference that seemed to argue that Zingarella made
no distinction between chairs and people, she took her seat between
the sculptor and the writer. She laughed, and yet it was not
laughter; she spoke, and her words were empty; she stretched out
her hands, and the gesture was lifeless. She fixed her eyes on
no one; she merely gazed about. She had a habit of shaking her
bracelet in a way that aroused sympathy. And after making a
lewd remark she would turn her head to one side, and thereby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>stagger even the most hardened frequenter of this sort of places.
Her complexion had been ruined by rouge, but underneath the
skin there was something that glimmered like water under thin ice.</p>

<p>The former winsomeness of her lips was still traceable in the
sorrowed curves of her now ravaged mouth.</p>

<p>At times her restless eyes, seeking whom they might entangle,
were fixed on Daniel, then sitting quite alone at the lower end
of the table. In order to avoid the unpleasant sensation associated
with the thought of going up to such a distinguished-looking person
and making herself known to him, she would have been grateful
had some one picked her up and thrown her bodily at his feet.
There was an element of strangeness about him. Zingarella saw
that he had had nothing to do with women of her kind. This
tortured her; she gnashed her teeth.</p>

<p>Daniel did not sense her hatred. As he looked into her face,
marked with a life of transgression and already claimed by fate,
he built up in his own soul a picture of inimitable chastity. He
tried to see the playmate of a god. The curtain decorated with
the distorted face of a harlequin, the acrobat and the dog trainer
at the adjacent table, who were quarrelling over their money, the
four half-grown gamblers directly behind him, the big fat woman
who was lying stretched out on a bench with a red handkerchief
over her face and trying to sleep, the writer who slandered other
writers, the inventor who discoursed so volubly and incessantly
on perpetual motion&mdash;to all of this he paid not the slightest bit of
attention. For him it could just as well have been in the bottom
of the sea. He got up and left.</p>

<p>But as he saw the snow-covered streets before him and was
unable to decide whether he should go home or not, Zingarella
stepped up to him. &#8220;Come, be quick, before they see that we are
together,&#8221; she whispered. And thus they walked along like two
fugitives, whose information concerning each other stops short with
the certainty that both are poor and wretched and are making their
way through a snow storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; asked Daniel.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Anna Siebert.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clock in the St. Lorenz Church struck three. The one
up in the tower of St. Sebaldus corroborated this reckoning by also
striking three and in much deeper tones.</p>

<p>They came to an old house, and after floundering through a
long, dark, ill-smelling passage way, entered a room in the basement.
Anna Siebert lighted a lamp that had a red chimney.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Gaudy garments of the soubrette hung on the wall. A big, grey
cat lay on the table cover and purred. Anna Siebert took the cat
in her arms and caressed it. Its name was Zephyr. It accompanied
her wherever she went.</p>

<p>Daniel threw himself on a chair and looked at the lamp. Zingarella,
standing before the mirror, stroked the cat. Gazing distractedly
into space, she remarked that the manager had discharged
her because the public was no longer satisfied with her work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this what you call the public?&#8221; asked Daniel, who never
once took his eyes from the lamp, just as Anna Siebert kept hers
rigidly fixed on the desolate distances of the mirror. &#8220;These
fathers of families who side-step every now and then, these counter-jumpers,
the mere looks of whom is enough to snatch your clothing
from your body, this human filth at the sight of which God must
conceal His face in shame&mdash;this is what you call the public?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, however that may be,&#8221; Anna Siebert continued in a
colourless voice, &#8220;the manager rushed into my dressing room, threw
the contract at my feet, and said I had swindled him. How on
earth could I have swindled him? I am no prima donna and my
agent had told him so. You can&#8217;t expect a Patti on twenty marks
a week. In Elberfeld I got twenty-five, and a year ago in Z&uuml;rich
I even drew sixty. Now he comes to me and says he doesn&#8217;t need
to pay me anything. What am I to live off of? And you&#8217;ve got
to live, haven&#8217;t you, Zephyr,&#8221; said Anna as she picked up the cat,
pressed its warm fur to her cheek, and repeated, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to
live.&#8221;</p>

<p>She let her arms fall to her sides, the cat sprang on the floor,
hunched up its back, wagged its tail, and purred. She then went
up to Daniel, fell on her knees, and laid her head on his side.
&#8220;I have reached the end,&#8221; she murmured in a scarcely audible
voice, &#8220;I am at the end of all things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The snow beat against the window panes. With an expression
on his face as though his own thoughts were murdering each other,
Daniel looked into the corner from which Zephyr&#8217;s yellowish eyes
were shining. The muscles of his face twitched like a fish on being
taken from the hook.</p>

<p>And as he cowered in this fashion, the poor girl pressed against
his body, his shoulders lowered, past visions again arose from the
depths of the sea. First he heard a ravishing arpeggio in A-flat major
and above it, a majestic theme, commanding quiet, as it were, in
sixteenth triads. The two blended, in <i>forte</i>, with a powerful
chord of sevens. There was a struggling, a separating, a wandering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>on, and out of the subdued pianissimo there arose and floated in
space a gentle voice in E-flat minor. O voice from the sea, O
humanity on earth! The eighth note, unpitiable as ever in its
elemental power, cut into the bass with the strength that moves
and burrows as it advances, until it was caught up by the redeemed
voice in E-flat major. And now everything suddenly became real.
What had formerly been clouds and dreams, longing and wishing,
at last took shape and form and stood before him. Indeed he himself
became true, real, and conscious of his existence in a world of
actualities.</p>

<p>On his way home he covered his face with his hands, for the
windows of the houses gaped at him like the hollow eyes of a
demi-monde.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Zingarella could not imagine why the strange man had left. He
seemed to be quite indifferent. Her heart beat with numerical
accuracy, but there was no strength in the beats. The sole creature
through which she was bound to the world was Zephyr.</p>

<p>Night followed night, day followed day. Each was like the
preceding. She spoke when people took enough trouble to speak
to her. She laughed when they had the incomprehensible desire
to hear laughter. To-day she wrapped this dress around her shivering
body, to-morrow another. She waited for the time to come
when she was to do something definite. She lay in bed and
dreaded the darkness; she pondered on the injustice of the world;
she thought of her own disgrace, and reflected on the need that
surrounded her. It was too much for her to bear.</p>

<p>A man would come, and at daylight he would leave and mingle
with the rest of the people on the street. When she awoke she
could no longer recall what he looked like. The landlady would
bring in soup and meat. Then some one knocked at the door; but
she did not open it. She had no desire to find out who it was.
Perhaps it was the man who had been with her the night before;
perhaps it was another.</p>

<p>She had neither curiosity nor hope. Her soul had dissolved
like a piece of salt in water. When she returned home on the
third day she found Zephyr lying by the coal-scuttle dead. She
knelt down, touched the cold fur, wrinkled her brow, shook her
bracelet, and went out.</p>

<p>It was getting along toward night, and the air was heavy with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>mist. She went first through lighted streets, and then turned into
others that were not lighted. She passed through avenues of
leafless trees, and walked across silent squares. The snow made
walking difficult. When it was too deep, she was obliged to stop
every now and then and take a deep breath.</p>

<p>She reached the river at a point where the shore was quite flat
and the water shallow. Without thinking for a moment, without
a moment&#8217;s hesitation, just as if she were blind, or as if she saw
a bridge where there was none, she walked in.</p>

<p>First she felt the water trickling into her shoes. Then she could
feel her legs getting wet, as her clothes, soft, slippery, and ice-cold,
clung to her body. Now her breast was under the water, and
now her neck. She sank down, glided away, took one deep breath,
smiled, and as she smiled she lost consciousness.</p>

<p>The next day her body was washed up on the shore some distance
beyond the city. It was taken to the morgue of the Rochus
Cemetery.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Schwalbe, the sculptor, was attending a funeral. His nephew
had died, and was being buried in the same cemetery.</p>

<p>As he passed by the morgue he caught sight of the body of a
girl. After the child had been buried he went back to the morgue.
A few people were standing near the body, one of whom said,
&#8220;She was a singer down at the Academy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Schwalbe was struck by the pure and beautiful expression on the
girl&#8217;s face. He studied it long and with no little emotion. Then
he went to the superintendent, and asked if he might take a death
mask. The permission was given him, and in a few hours he
returned with the necessary implements.</p>

<p>When he removed the mask from the face, he held something
truly wonderful in his hands. It showed the features of a
sixteen-year-old girl, a face full at once of sweetness and melancholy,
and, most charming of all, an angelic smile on the curved
lips of this mouth of sorrow. It resembled the work of a
renowned artist, so much so that the sculptor was suddenly seized
with a burning desire to regain his lost art.</p>

<p>He was nevertheless obliged within a week to sell the mask
to the caster by whom he was employed in Pfannenschmied Street.
Schwalbe needed ready money. The caster hung the mask by the
door at the entrance to his shop.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p><h3>X</h3>

<p>At the end of December Daniel found himself with not a cent
of cash, so that he was obliged to sell his sole remaining treasure,
the score of the Bach mass in B-minor. Spindler had presented
it to him when he left, and now he had to take it to the second-hand
dealer and part with it for a mere pittance.</p>

<p>Unless he cared to lie in bed the whole day, he was obliged to
walk the streets in order to keep warm. His poverty made it out
of the question for him to go to any of the caf&eacute;s, and so he was
excluded from association with the brethren of the Vale of Tears.
He had moreover taken a violent dislike to them.</p>

<p>One evening he was standing out in front of the Church of
&AElig;gydius, listening to the organ that some one was playing. The
icy wind blew through his thin clothing. When the concert was
over he went down to the square, and leaned up against the wall
of one of the houses. He was tremendously lonesome; he was
lonely beyond words.</p>

<p>Just then two men came along who wished to enter the very
house against the wall of which he leaned. He was cold. One
of these men was Benjamin Dorn, the other was Jordan. Benjamin
Dorn spoke to him; Jordan stood by in silence, apparently
quite appreciative of the condition in which the young man found
himself, as he stood there in the cold and made unfriendly replies
to the questions that were put to him. Jordan invited Daniel up
to his room. Daniel, chilled to the very marrow of his bones, and
able to visualise nothing but a warm stove, accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>Thus Daniel came in contact with Jordan&#8217;s family. He had
three children: Gertrude, aged nineteen, Eleanore, aged sixteen,
and Benno, fifteen years old and still a student at the <i>gymnasium</i>.
His wife was dead.</p>

<p>Gertrude was said to be a pietist. She went to church every
day, and had an inclination toward the Catholic religion, a fact
which gave Jordan, as an inveterate Protestant, no little worry.
During the day she looked after the house; but as soon as she had
everything in order, she would take her place by the quilting
frame and work on crowns of thorns, hearts run through with
swords, and languishing angels for a mission. There she would
sit, hour after hour, with bowed head and knit.</p>

<p>The first time Daniel saw her she had on a Nile green dress,
fastened about her hips with a girdle of scales, while her wavy
brown hair hung loose over her shoulders. It was in this make-up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>that he always saw her when he thought of her years after: Nile
green dress, bowed head, sitting at the quilting frame, and quite
unaware of his presence, a picture of unamiability, conscious or
affected.</p>

<p>Eleanore was entirely different. She was like a lamp carried
through a dark room.</p>

<p>For some time she had been employed in the offices of the Prudentia,
for she wished to make her own living. So far as it was
humanly possible to determine from her casual remarks, she thoroughly
enjoyed her work. She liked to make out receipts for
premiums, lick stamps, copy letters, and see so many people come
in and go out. Stout old Diruf and lanky Zittel did everything
they could to keep her interested, and if, despite their efforts, it
was seen that a morose mood was invading her otherwise cheerful
disposition, they took her out to the merry-go-round, and in a
short time her wonted buoyancy had returned.</p>

<p>She seemed like a child, and yet she was every inch a woman.
She insisted on wearing her little felt cap at a jaunty angle on her
blond hair. When she entered the room, the atmosphere in it
underwent a change; it was easier to breathe; it was fresher.
People somehow disapproved of the fact that her eyes were so
radiantly blue, and that her two rows of perfect white teeth were
constantly shining from out between her soft, peach-like lips.
They said she was light-hearted; they said she was a butterfly.
Benjamin Dorn was of the opinion that she was a creature possessed
of the devil of sensuality and finding her completest satisfaction
in earthly finery and frippery. For some time there had been an
affair of an intimate nature between her and Baron von Auffenberg.
Just what it was no one knew precisely; the facts were not obtainable.
But Benjamin Dorn, experienced ferreter that he was,
could not see two people of different sexes together without imagining
that he was an accomplice in the hereditary sin of human kind.
And one day he caught Eleanore alone in the company of Baron
von Auffenberg. From that day on she was, in his estimation, a
lost soul.</p>

<p>The fact concerning Eleanore was this: life never came very
close to her. It comes right up to other people, strangles them,
or drags them along with it. It kept its distance from Eleanore,
for she lived in a glass case. If she had sorrow of any kind, if
some painfully indeterminable sensation was gnawing at her soul,
if the vulgarity and banality of a base and disjointed world came
her way, the glass case in which she lived simply became more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>spacious than ever, and the things or thoughts that swarmed around
it more and more incomprehensible.</p>

<p>One can always laugh if one lives in a glass case. Even bad
dreams remain on the outside. Even longing becomes nothing
more than a purple breath which clouds the crystal from without,
not from within.</p>

<p>The people were quite right in saying that Jordan was bringing
up his daughters like princesses. Both were far removed from the
customary things of life: the one was translated to the realm of
darkness, the other to that of light.</p>

<p>Daniel saw both of them. They were just as strange to him as
he to them. He saw the brother, too, a tall, glib, dapper youth.
He saw the old house with its dilapidated stairs, its rooms filled
with cumbersome, provincial furniture. He saw the alternating
currents of life in this family: there was now rest, now unrest,
now quiet, now storm. Life flowed out from the house, and then
life, the same or of a different origin, flowed back in again.
When he came, he talked with Jordan himself rather than with
any one else; for he always knew when Jordan would be at home.
They spoke in a free and easy fashion and about things in general.
If their conversation could be characterised more fully, it might
be said that Daniel was reserved and Jordan tactful. Gertrude
sat by the table and attended to her needlework.</p>

<p>Daniel came and warmed himself by the stove. If he was
offered a sandwich or a cup of coffee he declined. If the offer
was made with noticeable insistency, he shook his head and distorted
the features of his face until he resembled an irritated ape.
It was the peasant spirit of defiance in him that made him act this
way. He nourished a measure of small-minded anxiety lest he be
indebted to somebody for something. To temptations, yielding to
which would have been spiritually mortifying, he was impervious.
When, consequently, his need became overpowering, he simply
stayed away.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>His want grew into a purple sheen. To him there was an element
of the ridiculous in the whole situation: it was 1882 and he
had nothing to eat; he was twenty-three years old and quite without
food.</p>

<p>Frau Hadebusch, virago that she could be when a dubious
debtor failed to fulfil his obligations, stormed her way up the steps.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>The rent was long overdue, and uncanny councils were being held
in the living room, in which an invalid from the Wasp&#8217;s Nest and
a soap-maker from Kamerarius Street were taking part.</p>

<p>In his despair, Daniel thought of entering the army. He
reported at the barracks, was examined&mdash;and rejected because of
a hollow chest.</p>

<p>At first there was the purple sheen. He saw it as he stood on
the hangman&#8217;s bridge and looked down into the water where pieces
of ice were drifting about. But when he raised his distressed
face a gigantic countenance became visible. The great vaulted
arch of heaven was a countenance fearfully distorted by vengeance
and scorn. Of escape from it there could be no thought. Within
his soul everything became wrapped in darkness. Tones and pictures
ran together, giving the disagreeably inarticulate impression
that would be made by drawing a wet rag across a fresh, well-ordered
creation.</p>

<p>As he walked on, it seemed to him that the horror of the vision
was diminishing. The countenance became smaller and more
amiable. It was now not much larger than the fa&ccedil;ade of a church
and what wrath remained seemed to be concentrated in the forehead.
An old woman passed by, carrying apples in her apron.
He trembled at the smell of them; but he did not reach out; he
did not try to take a single one of them from her; he still held
himself in control. By this time the entire vision was not much
larger than the top of a tree, and in it were the traces of mercy.</p>

<p>The sun was high in the heavens, the snow was melting, birds
were chirping everywhere. As he sauntered along with uncertain
steps through Pfannenschmied Street he suddenly stopped as if
rooted to the pavement. There was the vision: he caught sight
of it in bodily form on the door jamb of the shop. He could
not see that it was the mask of Zingarella. Of course not, for it
was a transfigured face, and how could he have grasped a reality
in his present state of mind? He looked from within out. The
thing before him was a vision; it joined high heaven with the
earth below; it was a promise. He could have thrown himself
down on the street and wept, for it seemed to him that he was
saved.</p>

<p>The incomparable resignation and friendly grief in the expression
of the mask, the sanctity under the long eyelashes, the
half extinguished smile playing around the mouth of sorrow, the
element of ghostliness, a being far removed from death and equally
far removed from life&mdash;all this caused his feeling to swell into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>one of credulous devotion. His entire future seemed to depend
upon coming into possession of the mask. Without a moment&#8217;s
hesitation or consideration he rushed into the shop.</p>

<p>Within he found a young man whom the caster addressed most
respectfully as Dr. Benda, and who was about thirty years old.
Dr. Benda was being shown a number of successful casts of a
figure entitled &#8220;The Fountain of Virtue.&#8221; It was quite a little
while before the caster turned to Daniel and asked him what he
wanted. In a somewhat rude voice and with an unsteady gesture,
Daniel made it clear to him that he wished to buy the mask.
The caster removed it from the door, laid it on the counter, and
named his price. He looked at the shabby clothing of the newly
arrived customer, concluded at once that the price, ten marks,
would be more than he could afford, and turned again to Dr.
Benda, so that Daniel might have time to make up his mind.</p>

<p>The two conversed for quite a while. When the caster finally
turned around, he was not a little surprised to see that Daniel
was still standing at the counter. He stood there in fact with
half closed eyes, his left hand lying on the face of the mask.
The caster exchanged a somewhat dazed glance with Dr. Benda,
who, in a moment of forewarning sympathy, grasped the situation
perfectly in which the stranger found himself. Dr. Benda somehow
understood, owing to his instinct for appreciation of unusual
predicaments, the man&#8217;s poverty, his isolation, and even the ardour
of his wish. Subduing as well as he might the feeling of ordinary
reserve, he stepped up to Daniel, and said to him calmly,
quietly, seriously, and without the slightest trace of condescension:
&#8220;If you will permit me to advance you the money for the mask,
you will do me a substantial favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel gritted his teeth&mdash;just a little. His face turned to a
greenish hue. But the face of his would-be friend, schooled in
affairs of the spirit, showed a winning trace of human kindness.
It conquered Daniel; it made him gentle. He submitted. Dr.
Benda laid the money for the mask on the counter, and Daniel
was as silent as the tomb.</p>

<p>When they left the shop, Daniel held the mask under his
arm so tightly that the paper wrapping was crushed, if the mask
itself was not. The sad state of his clothing and his haggard
appearance in general struck Dr. Benda at once and forcibly. He
needed to ask but a few well chosen questions to get at the underlying
cause of this misery, physical and spiritual, in human form.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>He pretended that he had not lunched and invited Daniel to
be his guest at the inn at the sign of the Grape.</p>

<p>Daniel felt that his soul had suddenly been unlocked by a
magic key. At last&mdash;he had ears and could hear, eyes and could
see. It seemed to him that he had come up to earth from out
of some lightless, subterranean cavern. And when they separated
he had a friend.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> spectacle of wellnigh complete degeneracy offered by the
roister-doistering slough brethren of the Vale of Tears gave
Herr Carovius a new lease on life. He had a really affable tendency
to associate with men who were standing just on the brink
of human existence. He always drank a great deal of liqueur.
The brand he preferred above all others was what is known as
Knickebein. Once he had enjoyed his liberal potion, he became
jovial, friendly, companionable. In these moods he would venture
the hardiest of assertions, not merely in the field of eroticism, but
against the government and divine providence as well.</p>

<p>And yet, when he trippled home with mincing steps, there was
in his face an expression of cowardly, petty smirking. It was the
sign of his inner return to virtuous living; for his night was not
as his day. The one belied the other.</p>

<p>He had a quite respectable income; the house in which he lived
was his own private property. It was pointed out to strangers as
one of the sights of the town; it was certainly one of the oldest
and gloomiest buildings in that part of the country. An especially
attractive feature of it was the smart and graceful bay-window.
Above the beautifully arched outer door there was a patrician coat-of-arms,
consisting of two crossed spears with a helmet above.
This was chiselled into the stone. In the narrow court was a
draw-well literally set in a frame of moss. Each floor of the
house had its own gallery, richly supplied with the most artistic
of carvings. The stairway was spacious; the tread of the steps was
broad, the elevation slight; there were four landings. It symbolised
in truth the leisurely, comfortable tarrying of centuries
gone before and now a matter of easy memory only.</p>

<p>Often in the nighttime, Herr Carovius recognised in the distance
the massive figure of his brother-in-law, Andreas D&ouml;derlein,
the professor of music. Not wishing to meet him, Herr Carovius
would stand at the street corner, until the light from D&ouml;derlein&#8217;s
study assured him that the professor was at home. On other occasions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>he would come in contact with the occupant of the second
floor, Dr. Friedrich Benda. When these two came together, there
was invariably a competitive tipping of hats and passing of compliments.
Each wished to outdo the other in matters of courtesy.
Neither was willing to take precedence over the other. The
polished civility of the young man made an even greater degree
of pretty behaviour on the part of Herr Carovius imperative, with
the result that his excessive refinement of manners made him
appear awkward, while his embarrassment made coherent speech
difficult and at times impossible.</p>

<p>When however he came alone, he would take the huge key
from his pocket, unlock the door, light a candle, hold it high
above his head, and spy into every nook and cranny of the barn-like
hall before entering his apartment on the ground floor.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Herr Carovius was a regular customer at the Crocodile Inn; a
table was always reserved for him. Around it there assembled
every noon the following companions: Solicitor of the Treasury
Korn, assistant magistrate Hesselberger, assistant postmaster Kitzler,
apothecary Pflaum, jeweller Gr&uuml;ndlich, and baker Degen. Judge
Kleinlein also joined them occasionally as a guest of honour.</p>

<p>They gossiped about their neighbours, their acquaintances, their
friends, and their colleagues. What they said ran the whole
gamut of human emotions from an innocent anecdote up to venomous
calumny. Not a single event was immune from malicious
backstairs comment. Reputations were sullied without discrimination;
objections were taken to the conduct of every living soul;
every family was shown to have its skeleton in the closet.</p>

<p>When the luncheon was finished, the men all withdrew and
went about their business, with the exception of Herr Carovius.
He remained to read the papers. For him it was one of the
most important hours of the day. Having feasted his ears with
friends in private, he now turned to a study of the follies, transgressions,
and tragedies that make up everyday life.</p>

<p>He read three papers every day: one was a local sheet, one a
great Berlin daily, and the third a paper published in Hamburg.
He never deviated; it was these three, week in and week out. And
he read them from beginning to end; politics, special articles, and
advertisements were of equal concern to him. In this way he
familiarised himself with the advance of civilisation, the changes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>civic life was undergoing, and the general status of the aristocracy,
bourgeoisie, and proletariat.</p>

<p>Nothing escaped him. He was as much interested in the murder
of a peasant in a Pommeranian village as he was in the loss of a
pearl necklace on the Boulevard des Italiens in Paris. He read
with equal concentration of the sinking of a steamer in the South
Sea and the wedding of a member of the Royal Family in Westminster
Abbey. He could work up just as much enthusiasm over
the latest fashions as he could over the massacring of enslaved
Armenians by the Turks. If he read with care and reflection of
the death of a leading citizen, he pursued the same course with
regard to the reprehending of a relatively harmless vagabond.</p>

<p>It is only fair to remark, however, that his real sympathy was
with those events that have to be entered on the calamitous side
of life&#8217;s ledger. This was due to a bizarre kink in his philosophy:
he studied the world primarily from the point of view of its
wars, earthquakes, floods, hailstorms, cyclones, and public and
private tragedies in the lives of men. Happy and reassuring events,
such as the birth of a healthy child, the conferring of an order
of distinction, heroic deeds, the winning of a prize in the lottery,
the publication of a good book, or the announcement of a legitimate
and successful speculation made no impression on him. At
times they even annoyed him. He kept his mind, in other words,
riveted on the evils, sorrows, woes, and tribulations that come to
pass either on this earth or in the starry firmament above, and
that were somehow brought to his attention.</p>

<p>His brain was a storehouse of fearful and ferocious happenings;
it was a catalogue, an inventory of disease, seduction, theft, robbery,
larceny, assassination, murder, catastrophe, pest, incest, suicide,
duel, bankruptcy, and the never failing family quarrel.</p>

<p>If he chanced to enrich his collection by the addition of some
especially curious or unheard-of incident, he took out his pocket
diary, noted the date, and then wrote: &#8220;In Amberg a preacher
had a hemorrhage while delivering his morning sermon.&#8221; Or:
&#8220;In Cochin China a tiger killed and ate fourteen children, and
then, forcing its way into the bungalow of a settler, bit off the
head of a woman as she was sleeping peacefully by the side of
her husband.&#8221; Or: &#8220;In Copenhagen a former actress, now ninety
years old, mounted a huge vegetable basket on the market place,
and recited Lady Macbeth&#8217;s monologue. Her unconventional behaviour
attracted such a large crowd of passersby that several people
were crushed to death in the excitement.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p><p>This done, he would go home, happy as a man can be. To
idlers standing in the doorways or servants looking out the windows
he would extend the greetings of the day, and that with really
conspicuous cordiality.</p>

<p>If a fire broke out in the city, he was present. As his eyes
peered into the flames, they seemed intoxicated, obsessed, seized
with uncanniness. He would hum a tune of some sort, look into
the anxious faces of those immediately concerned, busy himself
with whatever had been salvaged, and attempt to force his gratuitous
advice on the fire chief.</p>

<p>If a prominent citizen died, he never failed to attend the
funeral, and, where possible, to join the procession on the way to
the cemetery. He would stand by the grave with bowed head,
and take in every word of the funeral discourse. But his lips
twitched in a peculiar fashion, as if he felt that he were understood,
and flattered.</p>

<p>And in truth all this did flatter him. The defeat, distress, and
death of other people, the betrayals that take place in any community,
the highhanded injustice of those in power, the oppression
of the poor, the violence that was done to right and righteousness,
and the sufferings which had to be borne by thousands
day after day, all this flattered him; it interested him; it lulled
him into a comfortable feeling of personal security.</p>

<p>But then he sat down at his piano at home, and played an
adagio of Beethoven or an impromptu by Schubert, his eyes with
fine frenzy rolling in the meantime. And when the mighty
chorus in a Bach oratorio resounded, he became pale with ecstasy.
At the hearing of a good song well sung he could shed copious
tears.</p>

<p>He idolised music.</p>

<p>He was a provincial with unfettered instincts. He was an
agitator with a tendency to conservatism. He was a Nero without
servants, without power, and without land. He was a musician
from despair and out of vanity. He was a Nero in our own day.</p>

<p>He was the Nero of our day living in three rooms. He was
a lonely bachelor and a bookworm. He exchanged his views
with the corner grocer; he discussed city ordinances with the night
watchman; he was a tyrant through and through and a hangman
at heart; he indulged in eavesdropping at the shrine of fate, and
in this way concocted the most improbable of combinations and
wanton deeds of violence; he was constantly on the lookout for
misfortune, litigation, and shame; he rejoiced at every failure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>and was delighted with oppression, whether at home or abroad.
He hung with unqualified joy on the imagined ruins of imaginary
disaster, and took equal pleasure in the actual debacles of life as it
was lived about him. And alongside of this innate and at times
unexpressed gruesomeness and bloodthirstiness, he was filled with
a torturing passion for music. This was Herr Carovius. Such
was his life.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>For nine long years, that is, from the time she was fifteen
until she was twenty-four, his sister Marguerite kept house for him.
She got his breakfast, made his bed, darned his socks, and brushed
his clothes; and all he knew about her was that she had yellowish
hair, a skin full of freckles, and a timid, child-like voice. His
astonishment was consequently unbounded when Andreas D&ouml;derlein
called one day and proposed to her. He had moved into the
house the year before. Herr Carovius was amazed for the very
simple reason that he had never known Marguerite except as a
fourteen-year-old girl.</p>

<p>He took her to task. With unusual effort she summoned the
courage to tell him that she was going to marry D&ouml;derlein. &#8220;You
are a shameless prostitute,&#8221; he said, though he did not dare to
show Andreas D&ouml;derlein the door. The wedding took place.</p>

<p>One evening he was sitting in the company of the young couple.
Andreas D&ouml;derlein, being in an unusually happy mood, went to
the piano, and began playing the shepherd&#8217;s motif from Wagner&#8217;s
&#8220;Tristan and Isolde.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herr Carovius sprang to his feet as if stung by a viper, and
exclaimed: &#8220;Stop playing that foul magic! You know as well as
you are living that I don&#8217;t believe in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, brother?&#8221; asked Andreas D&ouml;derlein, his
head bowed in grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you trying to do? Are you trying to teach me something
about this poisoner of wells?&#8221; shouted Herr Carovius, and
his face took on the enraged expression of a hunchback who has
just been taunted about his deformity. &#8220;Does the professor imagine
that he knows better than I do who this Richard Wagner is,
this comedian, this Jew who goes about masked as the Germanic
Messiah, this cacaphonist, this bungler, botcher, and bully, this
court sycophant, this Pulchinello who pokes fun at the whole
German Empire and the rest of Europe led about by the nose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>this Richard Wagner? Very well, if you have anything to teach
me about him, go on! Proceed! I am listening. Go on! Pluck
up your courage.&#8221; With this he leaned back in his chair, and
laughed a laughter punctuated with asthmatic sighs, his hands
in the meantime resting folded across his stomach.</p>

<p>Andreas D&ouml;derlein rose to his full stature, see-sawed a bit on
the tips of his toes, and looked down on Herr Carovius as one
might look down upon a flea that one had caught and was just
in the act of crushing between two finger nails. &#8220;Oh, ho,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;how interesting! Upon my word, brother Carovius, you
are an interesting individual. But if some one were to offer me
all the money in the world, I should not like to be so ... interesting.
Not I. And you, Marguerite, would you like to be so
interesting?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something distinctly annihilating in this air of
superiority. It had its full effect on Herr Carovius: his unleashed
laughter was immediately converted into a gurgling titter. He
opened his eyes wide and rolled them behind his nose-glasses,
thus making himself look like a water-spitting figure on a civic
fountain. Marguerite, however, timid as she was, never saying
a word without making herself smaller by hiding her hands, glanced
in helpless fashion from her brother to her husband, and dropped
her head before them.</p>

<p>Was the feeling of Herr Carovius for Andreas D&ouml;derlein one
of hatred? It was hatred and more. It was a feeling of venomous
embitterment with which he thought of him, his name, his
wife, his child, the thick, bulky wedding ring on his finger, and
the gelatinous mass of flesh on his neck. From that evening on
he never again visited his sister. If Marguerite got up enough
courage to visit him, he treated her with crabbed contempt. She
finally came to the point where she would pass his door with not
a thought of entering it.</p>

<p>When the first child was born and the maid brought him the
glad tidings, he squinted into the corner, tittered, and made bold
to say: &#8220;Well, my congratulations. It is good that the D&ouml;derleins
are not to become extinct, for so long as one of them is living,
<i>plaisir</i> will not have vanished from the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Dorothea formed in time the habit of playing on the
steps or around the old windlass well in the backyard. Herr
Carovius procured forthwith a mean dog and named him C&aelig;sar.
C&aelig;sar was tied to a chain, to be sure, but his snarls, his growls, his
vicious teeth were hardly calculated to inspire the child with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>love for the place near him. She soon stopped playing at home.</p>

<p>Four years had elapsed since the Carovius-D&ouml;derlein wedding.
Herr Carovius was celebrating his birthday. Marguerite called
with Dorothea. The child recited a poem which she had learned
by heart for her uncle&#8217;s benefit. Carovius shook with laughter
when he saw the girl dressed up like a doll and realised that the
recital was imminent. Dorothea had of course the enunciation
of one of her age. When through, Herr Carovius said: &#8220;Honestly,
it would never have occurred to me that such a little toad could
croak so beautifully.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though the man knew so little about women that it would
be perilous to attempt to measure his ignorance of them, he nevertheless
felt, as he looked into Marguerite&#8217;s radiant face, a certain
disappointment in life&mdash;a disappointment which he would try
at once to benumb but which delighted him.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>About this time Herr Becker died. He was the senior city
official, and had been living in the second story of the apartment
for twenty-eight years. Dr. Benda moved in at once with his
mother.</p>

<p>Carovius told all about this at the reserved table in the Crocodile.
His companions were in a position to tell him a great deal more
about the ancestry and past life of the Bendas. They were said
to have been very rich once, to have lost their money in the
great panic, and to be living at present in quite moderate circumstances.
Benda&#8217;s father was said to have shot himself, and his
mother was reported to have taken the boy to school every morning.
Solicitor Korn had been told that, despite his youth, Dr.
Benda had written a number of scientific books on biology, but
that this had not enabled him to reach his desired goal.</p>

<p>&#8220;What goal?&#8221; the table companions asked in unison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he wanted to be made a professor, but people had
objected.&#8221; Why had they objected? came the question from more
than one throat. &#8220;Well, you see it was this way: the man is a
Jew, and the authorities are not going to appoint a Jew to an official
position in a university without raising objections. That is
to be taken as a matter of course.&#8221; That this was in very truth
to be taken as a matter of course was also the opinion of Herr
Carovius, who, however, insisted that Benda didn&#8217;t exactly look
like a Jew; he looked more like a tolerably fat Dutchman. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>was in truth not quite blond, but he was not dark either, and his
nose was as straight as a rule.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just the point: that&#8217;s the Jewish trick,&#8221; remarked the
Judge, and took a mighty draught from his beer glass. &#8220;In olden
times,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the Jews all had the yellow spots, aquiline noses,
and hair like bushmen. But to-day no Christian can be certain
who is Jew and who is Gentile.&#8221; To this the whole table agreed.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius at once began a system of espionage. He studied
the faces of the new tenants, and was particularly careful to note
when they went out and when they came in and with whom they
associated. He knew precisely when they turned the lights out
at night and when they opened the windows in the morning. He
could tell exactly how many rugs they had, how much coal they
burned, how much meat they ate, how many letters they received,
what walks they preferred, what people they spoke to, and who
recognised them. As if this were not enough, he went down to
the bookstore, bought the complete works of Dr. Benda, and read
these heavy scientific treatises in the sweat of his brow. He was
annoyed at the thought that they had not been critically reviewed.
He would have embraced any one who would have told him that
they were all perfectly worthless compilations.</p>

<p>One evening, along towards spring, he chanced to go into the
backyard to feed C&aelig;sar. He looked up, and saw Marguerite
standing on the balcony. She did not see him, for she was also
looking up. On the balcony of the second floor, across the court
from her, stood Friedrich Benda, responding to some mute signals
Marguerite was giving him. Finally they both stopped and merely
looked at each other, until Marguerite caught sight of her brother,
when she quickly disappeared behind the glass door draped with
green curtains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha,&#8221; thought Carovius, &#8220;there&#8217;s something up.&#8221; The scene
warmed his very blood.</p>

<p>From that day on he avoided the court. He sat instead for
hours at a time in a room from which he could look out through a
crack and see everything that was taking place at the windows
and on the balconies. He discovered that signals were being sent
from the first floor up to the second by changing the position of
a flower pot on the railing of the balcony, and that these signals
were answered by having a yellow cloth flutter on now a vertical,
now a horizontal pole.</p>

<p>At times Marguerite would come out quite timidly, and look
up; at times Benda appeared, and stood for a while at the window
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>completely absorbed, as it seemed, in melancholy thoughts. Herr
Carovius caught them together but on one single occasion. He
opened the window as quickly as he could, and placed his ear
so that he could hear what was being said, but it so happened that
over in the adjoining yard some one was just then nailing a box
together. As a result of the noise it was impossible for him to
understand their remarks.</p>

<p>Since that day they exchanged no more signals, and never again
appeared on the balcony.</p>

<p>Carovius rubbed his hands at the thought that the majestic
Andreas D&ouml;derlein had after all grown horns. But his joy waned
when he reflected that two other people were deriving profit from
the situation. That should not be; that had to be corrected.</p>

<p>And so he stood at times in the evening out in the narrow passage
at the entrance to his apartment. His bathrobe fell down
over his bony body in many folds. In his right hand he carried
a candle. Thus equipped, he listened in, or rather into, the
stillness of the house.</p>

<p>At times he would take a dark lantern, walk up the stairs slowly,
step by step, and listen, listen with the greedy ears of a man
who was determined to hear something. There was something
in the air that told him of secret, and of course illicit, transactions.</p>

<p>Was it the same medium through which he learned of the
weakening of Marguerite&#8217;s mind and the beclouding of her soul?
Was it this that told him of her mental anxiety and the ever
growing delusion of her terrified and broken heart?</p>

<p>Later he learned of her mad outbursts of anxiety concerning
the life of her child. He heard that she would never allow the
child out of her sight; that she regarded the natural warmth of
her body as a high fever; that every morning she would stand by
Dorothea&#8217;s bed, weep, take her in her arms, feel her pulse, and
wrap her body in warm clothing. He heard, too, that night after
night she sat by the child&#8217;s bedside watching over her and praying
for her, while the child herself slept like an old shoe. All
this he learned from the maid.</p>

<p>One day Herr Carovius came home, and found an ambulance
and a crowd of gaping people before the house. As he went up
the stairway he heard a hushed whimpering. Marguerite was
being dragged from the house by two men. The rear of this
procession was brought up by Andreas D&ouml;derlein, on whose face
there was an expression of accusation. The room door was open.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>He looked in, and saw bits of broken glasses and dishes, and in
the midst of the debris sat Dorothea. Her mouth was puckered
as if just on the point of weeping, and a cloth was bound about
her forehead. The maid stood in the door wringing her hands.
And on a step above was Friedrich Benda, white as a sheet, and
evidently suffering from great mental anxiety.</p>

<p>Marguerite offered but little resistance. She looked behind her,
and tried to see what the child was doing. Herr Carovius buried
his hands in his overcoat pockets, and followed the mournful
caravan out on to the street. The poor woman was taken to the
insane asylum at Erlangen.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius said to himself: somebody is responsible for all
this. He determined at once to bring the guilty party to account.
He took this stand neither out of grief nor from a feeling of
love for his fellow men. His action was motivated by his hatred
of a world in which something is constantly going on, and in
the midst of which he was condemned to an inactive and deedless
life.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Not much could be learned from D&ouml;derlein&#8217;s maid. The efforts
to draw something out of little Dorothea were also fruitless. She
was wrapped up in her own affairs. She arranged her ribbons,
played with her toys, recounted the small incidents of her uneventful
life, and could hardly be persuaded even to listen to the
ingenious questions Carovius put to her when he stopped her out
in the hall and asked her about this and that.</p>

<p>One day he went over to Erlangen to visit his sister in the
insane asylum. He thought that he might be able to get some
clue to this mystery from her.</p>

<p>He found her sitting in the corner of a room, stroking her
long, yellowish hair. Her head was bowed; her eyes were fixed
on the floor. Through no cunning that he could devise was it
possible to entice a single statement from her.</p>

<p>The physician said: &#8220;She is a harmless patient, but most secretive
and passionate. She must have suffered for years from some
heavy burden on her soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herr Carovius left her, and went back to the station. The
sun was shining bright. He soon saw to his infinite discomfort
that it was impossible to eliminate the picture of the melancholy
woman from his inner eye. He went into a caf&eacute; and drank some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>whiskey. On the return journey an old woman sat opposite him
who seemed to understand him. There was a trace of compassion
in her eyes. This made him so uneasy that he found it necessary
to change his seat.</p>

<p>He had met with unanticipated difficulties in his investigation.
He recognised these fully, but consoled himself with the
thought that there was still time. It occurred to him that he
might somehow get hold of Dr. Benda and cross-question him. He
recalled having seen Friedrich Benda meet little Dorothea on the
stairway once, and no sooner had he seen her coming than he made
every effort to avoid her. That set Carovius to thinking.</p>

<p>Some gas pipes had to be installed in the apartment about
that time, and this gave him, as superintendent, a splendid opportunity
to go up and see Benda. The doctor was just then
making his final attempt to claim his rights&mdash;the rights of a man
and a scholar&mdash;against the conspiracy of enemies who were really
immune before the law.</p>

<p>He was all alone when Carovius called. He took him straight
to his study. The walls of his hall as well as those of his room
were covered with books from floor to ceiling. Benda said he
was just getting ready to go on an extended journey. The finished
politeness with which he removed the books from a chair and the
tense way in which he eyed Herr Carovius made it clear to the
latter that this was neither the time nor the place to engage in mock
conversation. Carovius talked gas pipes. Benda finished all he had
to say on this subject in two short, crisp sentences and got up to
go.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius got up too, removed his nose glasses, and rubbed
them with his bright blue handkerchief. &#8220;Where are you going, if
I may ask?&#8221; There was an expression of apparent sympathy in his
question.</p>

<p>Benda made it a habit never to treat any man impolitely, however
little regard he might have for him personally. He said that
he was going to Kiel to deliver his trial lecture at the university.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravo!&#8221; cried Carovius, falling at once into the tone of awkward
familiarity. &#8220;You have simply got to show those fellows
that you are not a coward. Bravo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand you,&#8221; said Benda in amazement. His
antipathy for the man was growing. And no one recognised this
better than Carovius himself.</p>

<p>He cast a sideglance that reeked with hypocrisy at the young
scholar. &#8220;My dear doctor, you must not look upon me as a poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>uncultured yokel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;<i>anch&#8217; io sono pittore</i>. I have read,
among other things, your monograph on the morphogenetic achievements
of the original sulcate cell. Listen, man! I take off
my hat to that book. Of course, it is not exactly original, but
then it is one of your earlier works. The idea developed in it
follows pretty closely that of the evolutionary and mechanical
theories of the much slandered Wilhelm Roux. And yet I am
bound to say you display considerable independence in your
method. Indeed you do. And more than that, you throw much
needed light on the mysteries of God himself. There is a good
deal of incoherent drivel these days about the freedom of science.
Well, you&#8217;ll have to show me where it is. Scientists? They
are a lot of conceited pin-heads, each working for himself, and
incurably jealous of what his colleagues are doing. Up and at &#8217;em,
Doctor, that&#8217;s my advice, and luck to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benda was amazed to hear Carovius mention a work that was
otherwise known only to specialists. This however merely tended
to increase his distrust. He knew too much about the man to
stand before him without a feeling of hostility. He merely
needed to call to mind the story of the woman whose youth he
had made into a waste place and a prison to be made aware of the
fact that it was quite impossible to stand in his presence and
breathe easily. The air of the room in which Carovius chanced
to be was heavy, stuffy, depressing.</p>

<p>Benda&#8217;s bearing, however, remained unchanged. He replied in
a serious tone: &#8220;It is not after all easy to get along with people.
Each has his own place and wants to keep it. I thank you very
much for your visit and your kind words, but my time is limited.
I have a great deal to do&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly,&#8221; said Carovius hastily, while a rancorous grin
flitted across his face, &#8220;but you don&#8217;t need to drive me away.
I am going on my own accord. I have an engagement at the
district court at five o&#8217;clock, I am to sign some sort of a document
concerning the detention of my sister in the insane asylum. It
probably has to do with the settling of her estate or something
like that. Who knows? By the way, what have you to say
about the affair? You knew her rather intimately. No hedging,
doctor. There she sits in the cell and combs her hair. Can you
imagine who is responsible? You know a woman doesn&#8217;t lose
her mind from a mere love affair. And this music swindler down
stairs&mdash;it is impossible to get him to show his true colours. Yes,
we all have our troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p><p>In order to take the sting out of his impudent insinuations,
for he regretted having made a premature move with his trump
card, Carovius smiled in a scurrilous fashion, ducked his head,
coward that he was, and riveted his greedy, banal eyes on Benda.</p>

<p>But Benda was looking down. His eyes had been attracted
by the fancy buckle shoes of Herr Carovius. He was repelled
by the man&#8217;s foppish socks with the yellow stripes which were
made more conspicuous by the fact that his trousers were too high.
He had a feeling of unmitigated mental nausea, too, when he
noticed how Carovius lifted first one foot and then the other from
the floor, and then set it down, heel first. It was a detestable
habit; and indulging in it made an ugly noise.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Benda&#8217;s absence lasted for hardly a year. His mother had not
accompanied him this time. She was not feeling well, and there
was some danger that she was losing her eyesight.</p>

<p>After his return he took to silent brooding. Though he never
said a word to his mother about the disappointment he had experienced,
she knew precisely what he had gone through, and
spared him the humiliation that would have followed any questions
she might have asked.</p>

<p>He was oppressed by the memories the house awakened in him.
Forgotten pictures became living ones. The figure of the murdered
woman appeared in the nighttime on the balcony. Her shadow
fell upon him, nestled up to him in fact, as he sat at his writing-desk.</p>

<p>There were a great many things that still bound him to her
whose spirit had vanished from the earth, though her body remained.</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to forget her gentle look or the
coyness of her hands. He knew her fate; he knew her soul.
But he was condemned to silence. To withdraw from contact
with the world and into the deepest of loneliness had been her
lot; it had also been his. At present it was possible to get only
one picture of her, the one her brother had given: she sat in her
cell and combed her yellow hair.</p>

<p>He held no one responsible; he blamed no one. He merely
regretted that men are as they are.</p>

<p>A former university friend of his came in, and tried to get
him interested in collaborating on a great scientific work. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>declined. As soon as his colleague of other days had gone, he visualised
to himself the entire conversation: The man was affable
and insistent; and yet there was in his very being an underground,
enigmatic hostility. It was the hostility he invariably felt whenever
he had anything to do, either of a purely external, business
nature or in a social way, with men of other faith. The least
he had to fear was a prejudiced inimicality, as if the individual
in question were on the point of calling out to him: You stay
on that side, I&#8217;ll stay on this. Keep off the bridge.</p>

<p>He was fully aware of this, but his pride forbade his fighting
against it. He renounced his natural right to life and a living.
He declined the university conceded privilege of co-existence.
To go out and actually win for himself the right to participate
in the inevitable contest of forces, or to secure even this poor
privilege by supplication, or to defend it by argument, or to cajole
it into his possession by political wiles, seemed to him contrary
to reason and at odds with common sense. He would not do it.</p>

<p>He refused to knock at the door which he himself had bolted
and barricaded.</p>

<p>From this self-imposed embarrassment he suffered to an almost
intolerable degree. It was the irrational and fraudulent phase
of matters that made him suffer. Did men act as they did because
they were so strong in their faith? Not at all. Did he believe
in those racial differences which made them believe? Not at
all. He felt at home on the soil that nourished him; he felt
under obligations to the weal and woe of his people; he was
bound heart and soul to the best of them, and realised that he had
been spiritually developed by their language, ideas, and ideals.</p>

<p>Everything else was a lie. They knew that it was a lie too,
but out of his pride they forged a weapon and turned it against
him. To deny his relationship to them, a relationship that had
been proved by his achievements and enthusiasm, was a part of
their plan; it was also a part of their evil designs.</p>

<p>To strike up acquaintances, seek out congenial companions, or
take an active part in social organisations was repulsive to him.
He did not care to be dragged into fruitless and empty community
of effort or social co-operation. Defiant and alone, he explained
his case to himself. Since it merely intensified his agony to
compare his lot with that of others who seemed to be similarly
situated, he did not do it. He avoided in truth all reflections that
might have made the world appear to him as having at least a semblance
of justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p><p>He was consequently filled with a longing which took more
definite shape day by day, and finally developed into a positive
and irrevocable decision.</p>

<p>About this time he made the acquaintance of Daniel, and
through him he came to know other people. He saw at once that
there was something unusual about Daniel; that there was something
in him which he had never before noticed in any one. Even
his outer distress was a challenge to greater activity, while his
inner agitation never permitted his associates to rest in idle peace.</p>

<p>It was not easy to be of assistance to him; he rejected all
gifts which he could not repay. He had to be convinced first
of his duty and indebtedness to the friend whom fate had made
cross his path. And even then he stood out for the privilege of
being theoretically ungrateful.</p>

<p>Benda and his mother succeeded in getting him a position
as a tutor in some private families. He had to give piano lessons
to young boys and girls. The compensation was not great, but
it at least helped him out for the time being.</p>

<p>After the day&#8217;s work was done, the evenings and nights bound
the two more and more firmly together.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>One evening Daniel entered the house and met Herr Carovius.
But he was so absorbed in thought that he passed by without
noticing him. Carovius looked at him angrily, and walked back
to the hall to see where the young man was going. When he
heard him ring the bell on the second floor, an uneasy expression
came over his face. He rubbed his chin with his left hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea of passing by me as though I were a block of wood,&#8221;
murmured Carovius spitefully. &#8220;Just wait, young man, I&#8217;ll make
you pay for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead of leaving the house as he had wished, Carovius went
into his apartment, lighted a candle, and tripped hastily through
three rooms, in which there were old cabinets and trunks filled
with books and music scores. There was also a piano in one. He
then took a key from his pocket, and unlocked a fourth room,
which had closed shades and was in fact otherwise quite oddly
arranged.</p>

<p>He went to a table which reached almost the full length of the
room, picked up a piece of white paper, sat down, and wrote with
red ink: &#8220;Daniel Nothafft. Musician. Two months in jail.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p><p>He then covered the paper with mucilage, pasted it on a
wooden box which looked like a miniature sentry-house, and nailed
a lid on the box, using tacks that were lying ready for this purpose.</p>

<p>There were at least five dozen such boxes on the long table, the
majority of which had names attached to them and had been
nailed up.</p>

<p>The closed room Herr Carovius called his court chamber. What
he did in it he termed the regulation of his affairs with humanity,
and the collection of little wooden cells he called his jail. Every
individual who had offended, hurt, humiliated, or defrauded him
was assigned such a keep in which he was obliged to languish,
figuratively, until his time, determined by a formal sentence, was
up.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. In the middle section of the table there
were a number of diminutive sand heaps, about thirty in all, and
on each one was a small wooden cross and on each cross was a
name. That was Herr Carovius&#8217;s cemetery, and those who were
figuratively buried there were, so far as he was concerned, dead,
even though they were still going about their earthly affairs as
lively and cheerful as ever. They were people whose mundane
careers were finished, as he saw it, and under each of their accounts,
reckoned exclusively in sins, he had drawn a heavy line. They
were such people as Richard Wagner and his champions, the local
stationer to whom he had advanced some money years ago and
who entered a plea of bankruptcy a few months later, the authors
of bad books that were widely read, or of books which he loathed
without having read them, as, for instance, those of Zola.</p>

<p>There were still a third noteworthy section of the table, and
that was the so-called Academy. This consisted of a plot of
ground, surrounded by an iron fence, and divided up into twelve
or fifteen square fields, each of which was painted in fresh green.
In the middle of each field there was a wooden peg about two
inches high, and to the middle of each peg there was attached a
name-plate. From the tops of some of these pegs little banners
of green cloth fluttered in the breeze.</p>

<p>The fact is, Herr Carovius had a weakness for association with
aristocrats. In his heart of hearts he admired the manners of the
aristocracy, their indifference and self-complacency, their irrefragable
traditions and their noiseless and harmonious behaviour. To
the pegs of the Academy he had affixed the names of some of
the best families he had known; among others, those of the Tuchers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>the Hallers, the Humbsers, the Kramer-Kleets, and the Auffenbergs.
Whenever he had succeeded in making the personal acquaintance
of the members of any of these families, he went
straightway to the Academy and hoisted the appropriate flag.</p>

<p>But, despite all his effort, he had never in the course of time
been able to run up more than three flags, and these only for a
brief period and without any marked success. Some one had
recognised him on the street or spoken to him at the concert, and
that was all. The Academy looked, in contradistinction to the
jail and the cemetery, quite deserted. Finally he was able to
hoist the Auffenberg banner. Herr Carovius felt that the Academy
had a great future.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Kropotkin the painter had once upon a time received an order
to make a copy of a Holbein for Baron Siegmund von Auffenberg.
He never finished the picture, owing to lack of ability; but he
had become acquainted with Baron Eberhard, and years later,
having met him quite accidentally, took him to the Paradise, where
the infamous brethren were then in the habit of gathering.</p>

<p>Eberhard&#8217;s appearance at the Paradise was short-lived; he disappeared
in fact as quickly as he had appeared. But this brief
space was sufficient for Herr Carovius to become intimately acquainted
with him.</p>

<p>The first time he sat at the same table with him he was
noticeably excited. His face shone with a mild spiritual glow.
His voice was sweet and gentle, his remarks of an unusually agreeable
moderation.</p>

<p>He turned the conversation to a discussion of the superiorities
of birth, and lauded the distinction of the hereditary classes. He
said it was from them only that the people could acquire civic
virtue. The brethren scorned his point of view. Herr Carovius
came back at them with an annihilating jest.</p>

<p>During the rendition of this hallelujah-solo in praise of the
nobility, Eberhard von Auffenberg intrenched himself behind a
sullen silence. And though Carovius used every available opportunity
from then on to flatter the young nobleman in his cunning,
crafty way, he failed. The most he could do was to inspire
Eberhard to lift his thrush-bearded chin in the air and make some
sarcastic remark. Fawn as he might, Carovius was stumped at
every turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p><p>One night, however, the two enjoyed each other&#8217;s company on
the way home. That is, Carovius never left Eberhard&#8217;s side.
Annoyed at the failure of his former tactics, he thought he would
try his luck in another way: he ridiculed the arrogance of a certain
caste which affected to attach less importance to a man like himself
than to some jackanapes whose handkerchief was adorned with
an embroidered crown.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you, any way, what is your vocation?&#8221; asked Eberhard
von Auffenberg.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t do anything,&#8221; replied Carovius.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing at all? That is quite agreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I do work a little at music,&#8221; added Herr Carovius, entirely
pleased at the curiosity of the Baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you see, that is after all something,&#8221; said the Baron.
&#8220;I for my part am as unmusical as a shot-gun. And if you do
not do anything but interest yourself in music, you must have a
great deal of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herr Carovius turned away. The positive dread of being
taken for a rich man wrestled with the vain desire to make the
young Baron feel that he really was somebody. &#8220;I have a little,&#8221;
he remarked with a titter, &#8220;a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; if you will loan me ten thousand marks, it will
give me great pleasure to make you a present of the crown on my
handkerchief,&#8221; said Eberhard von Auffenberg.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius stopped stock still, and opened his mouth and his
eyes: &#8220;Baron, you are taking the liberty of jesting with me.&#8221;
But when Eberhard indicated that he was quite serious, Carovius
continued, blank amazement forcing his voice to its highest pitch:
&#8220;But my dear Sir, your father has an income of half a million.
A mere income! The tax receipts show it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am not talking about my father,&#8221; said Eberhard
coldly, and once more threw his chin in the air. &#8220;It is evidently
a part of your heraldic prejudices to feel that you can coax the
income of my father into my own pockets.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were standing under a gas lamp at the Haller Gate.
It was dripping rain, and they had raised their umbrellas. It
was perfectly still; it was also late. Not a human being was to
be seen anywhere. Carovius looked at the seriously offended young
man, the young man looked at Carovius, then grinning a grin of
embarrassment, and neither knew how to take the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are surprised,&#8221; said Eberhard, resuming the conversation.
&#8220;You are surprised, and I don&#8217;t blame you. I am a discontented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>guest in my own skin; that much I can assure you. I am as
abortive a creature as ever was born. I inherited far too much
that is superfluous, and not nearly enough of the necessities.
There are all manner of mysteries about me; but they are on the
outside. Within there is nothing but stale, dead air.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared at the ground as though he were talking to himself,
and as though he had forgotten that any one was listening, and
continued: &#8220;Have you ever seen old knights carved in stone
in old churches? If you have, you have seen me. I feel as
if I were the father of my father, and as if he had had me buried
alive, and an evil spirit had turned me to stone, and my hands
were lying crossed over my breast and could not move. I grew
up with a sister, and I see her as though it were yesterday&#8221;&mdash;at
this point his face took on an expression of fantastic senility&mdash;&#8220;walking
through the hall, proud, dainty, innocent, with roses
in her hand. She is married to a captain of cavalry, a fellow
who treats his men like Negro slaves, and who never returns the
greeting of a civilian unless he is drunk. She had to marry him.
I could not prevent it. Somebody forced her into it. And if
she is carrying roses now, it is as if a corpse were singing songs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herr Carovius felt most uneasy. He was not accustomed to
hearing things like this. Where he lived people called a spade a
spade. He pricked up his ears and made a wry face. &#8220;It is the
way he has been trained that makes him talk like that,&#8221; he
thought; &#8220;it is the result of constantly sitting on gold-embroidered
chairs and seeing nothing about him but paintings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to sit on such chairs too,&#8221; he was happy to think,
&#8220;and I shall see the paintings, too.&#8221; He pictured himself between
the Baron and the Baroness, marching up to the portals of the castle,
flanked on either side by a row of liveried servants, the nervous
masses catching sight of the splendour as well as they might. The
rear of this procession was being brought up by the young Baron,
who had returned home as the penitent Prodigal Son.</p>

<p>&#8220;One must have a feeling of personal security,&#8221; remarked
Carovius. He wondered whether the Baron had reached his
majority. Eberhard replied that he had just completed his twenty-first
year, and that certain things had made him feel that it
would be wise to live independent of his family and to renounce
his claims to all family rights for the time being. What he
really had in mind was the desire to avoid, so far as humanly
possible, association with all professional money-lenders.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius felt that this was an extremely serious case.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>He claimed moreover to understand it perfectly and to be ready
for anything, but insisted that nothing must be withheld, that he
must be given undiluted wine. He made this remark just as
if he were holding a glass of old Johannisberger out in the rain,
sniffing as he did with appreciative nostrils.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very discreet,&#8221; he said, &#8220;very taciturn.&#8221; He looked at
the Baron tenderly.</p>

<p>The young Baron nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wearer of purple is recognised wherever he goes,&#8221; continued
Herr Carovius, &#8220;and if he lays the purple aside he stands
at once in need of reticent friends. I am reserved.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baron nodded again. &#8220;If you will permit me, I shall visit
you in a few days.&#8221; With that he ended the conversation.</p>

<p>He started off toward the Avenue, walking stiffly. It was
not hard to see that he was ill at ease. Herr Carovius walked
away with mincing, merry steps down toward the small end of
the alley, singing an aria from the &#8220;Barber of Seville&#8221; as he
went.</p>

<p>At the end of the first week he was taken down with a disconcerting
suspicion that the Baron had made a fool of him. He
was filled with a wrath that had to be cooled. One morning,
just as he was leaving his apartment, he saw two milk cans filled
with milk standing in the outer hall. One was for the first floor,
the other for the second. The milkmaid had placed them there
for the time being, and had gone over to have a little morning
chat with her neighbour. Herr Carovius went to his lumber-room,
which also served as the kitchen, took down a jug of vinegar,
came back, looked around with all the caution he could summon,
and then poured half of the contents of the jug into one can
and the other half into the other.</p>

<p>Two days later he decided not to give C&aelig;sar anything to eat, so
that he would terrify the neighbours by his howling. This worked.
The dog howled and whined and barked night after night. It
was enough to melt the heart of a stone. Nobody could sleep.
Andreas D&ouml;derlein went to the police, but they told him that the
case was beyond their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius lay in bed rejoicing with exceeding great joy
over the fact that the people could not sleep. He became enamoured
of the idea that it might be possible, through some ingenious
invention, to rob a whole city or a whole nation of its sleep.
The inventor could then move about conscious of the fact that he
was at once the distributor and the destroyer of the world&#8217;s supply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>of sleep. If he so elected to exploit his invention, he could
revel in the sight of an entire people pining, drying up, and
eventually dying from the want of sleep.</p>

<p>After C&aelig;sar had become quite savage, Herr Carovius decided
to unleash him. It was just after sunset. He slipped up to the
beast from the rear, and opened the chain lock. The dog ran
like mad through the court and the hall, and out on to the
street.</p>

<p>Just at this moment young Baron von Auffenberg was entering
to pay Herr Carovius that promised visit. He jumped back
from the beast, but it sprang at his body, and in a jiffy the Baron
was lying full length on the pavement. C&aelig;sar left him, made a
straight line for the open door of a butcher shop across the street,
sprang in, and snatched a fancy cut from one of the hooks.</p>

<p>In order to see just how much damage the dog would really do,
Herr Carovius ran after him, hypocritically feigning as he ran
an expression of horror, and acting as though the beast had somehow
broken his chain and got loose. The first sight that caught
his eyes was that of the young Baron as he rose to his feet and
limped over toward his host to-be.</p>

<p>The horror of Herr Carovius at once became real. With the
diligence of a seasoned flunkey, he stooped over, picked up the
Baron&#8217;s hat, dusted it, stammered all sorts of apologies, gazed at
high heaven like a martyred saint, and brushed the dirt from Eberhard&#8217;s
trousers. Then the dog came back, a huge piece of meat
in his mouth. The butcher came to the door and shook his
fists. The butcher&#8217;s boy stuck two fingers in his mouth, and
whistled for the police. They came, too, and Herr Carovius had
to pay for the meat.</p>

<p>He then took the Baron into his living-room, plying him in the
meantime with innumerable questions as to how he felt. Having
been stunned by the fall, the Baron asked to lie down for a few
minutes on the couch. Herr Carovius granted his wish, smothering
him with sighs of affection and exclamations of regret.</p>

<p>As the Baron lay on the couch, trying to regain his vital spirits,
Herr Carovius went to the piano and played the rondo from
Weber&#8217;s sonata in A flat major. His technique was superb; his
emotion was touching.</p>

<p>After the concert the transactions began.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span><a name="INSPECTOR_JORDAN_AND_HIS_CHILDREN" id="INSPECTOR_JORDAN_AND_HIS_CHILDREN"></a>INSPECTOR JORDAN AND HIS CHILDREN</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Benno Jordan</span> was now a senior in the <i>gymnasium</i> and had
begun to play mischievous pranks. He also declared that he was
no longer minded to tolerate the tyranny of the school, and that
he had not the slightest desire to enter the university. He was
a wilful, obstinate boy with a marked tendency to sociability. He
paid a great deal of attention to his clothes, and was proud of his
handsome face.</p>

<p>After repeated conversations with the seventeen-year-old boy,
Jordan decided to get him a job as a clerk in the offices of the
Prudentia. He discussed the situation with the general agent, and
Alfons Diruf gave his consent. Benno began his work at fifty
marks a month.</p>

<p>When Jordan would come home of an evening, the first thing
he would hear from Eleanore was that Benno had an engagement
with some of his friends, and that they were in the Alfas Garden,
or in the Wolf&#8217;s Glen, or in Caf&eacute; Merkur, where the orchestrion,
then a new invention, was being played for the first time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, what is to become of the next generation?&#8221; said Jordan,
quite worried. &#8220;All they think about is having a good time.
Why, I never in my whole life thought of merely amusing myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anxious about Benno&#8217;s behaviour, Jordan called on the chief of
the clerical department. The little man with the waxened, weazened,
face expressed himself as quite satisfied with the new employ&eacute;.
Jordan took him by the hand; it was his way of displaying
gratitude. And he was grateful, though it was hard for him to
subdue a feeling of solicitude. He recognised the boy&#8217;s external
amiability, but felt convinced that this merely covered and concealed
a decayed soul.</p>

<p>Alfons Diruf was obese and gloomy. His clothes were made in
Paris, and on the ring finger of his left hand was a brilliant
diamond.</p>

<p>Since the Prudentia had introduced the so-called workmen&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>insurance, the number of clerks on its payroll had been increased
by about twenty-five thousand. Of these eighty-four were under
Diruf&#8217;s direct supervision. They were located in three rooms
of a house in F&uuml;rther Street. They were pale and they were
silent. Diruf himself had a private office which resembled the
boudoirs of a woman of the world. The curtains were of blue
silk, a bathing nymph by Thumann hung on the wall, and the
whole place smelled of musk.</p>

<p>Three times a day he would leave his fair retreat, and, with
the mien of disgust, make the rounds of the clerks&#8217; quarters.
When they saw him coming, heads ducked, hands scurried across
the books, feet stopped scraping, and all whispering died out.</p>

<p>He gave the impression of a man who hated his job, but in
reality he loved it. He liked the clerks because of their servile
docility and their famished faces. He liked them because they
came promptly every morning and went away every evening tired
as tired could be, and because day after day, year in and year out,
they sat there and wrote, wrote, wrote.</p>

<p>He liked the inspectors because day after day, year in and year
out, they did a great deal of work for a very little money. He
liked the agents and sub-agents who made it possible for the company
to issue hundreds of new policies every day. He liked their
dirty clothes and tattered boots, their hungry looks, their misleading
but effective line of talk, and their sad faces.</p>

<p>The special bait of the workmen&#8217;s insurance was the small
premium, carrying with it a small policy. In this way the man
of small means was to be educated in thrift. As a rule, however,
the small man realised, when it was too late, that the agent had
promised more than the company could do. He became distrustful;
his weekly savings were so scant that it was impossible
for him to pay his premiums regularly; with the expiration of
each week it became increasingly difficult to make up the back
payments, and, before he knew precisely what had happened, his
policy had been declared void, and the money he had paid in
on it confiscated.</p>

<p>In this way the company made millions. It was the pfennigs
of the poorest classes that constituted these millions, made the
dividends rise higher and higher, increased the army of clerks,
and filled the pockets of the agents.</p>

<p>These agents were recruited from the scum of human society.
They were made up of bankrupts, decadent students, gamblers,
topers, and beggars. They came from the ranks of those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>had been pursued by misfortune and who bore the marks of crime.
No one was too small or too bad.</p>

<p>Alfons Diruf, however, saw that it would vastly improve the
credit of the company if to this list of outcasts he would add a
few eminently respectable citizens. He consequently went out
on his own responsibility, and looked for help. His quest brought
him to Jason Philip Schimmelweis.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a gold mine,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you work for an ideal, and you
get something out of it for yourself. Ideals, incidentally, that
are not profitable are idiotic.&#8221; With that he blew the smoke
of his Havana cigar through his nose.</p>

<p>Jason Philip understood. It was not necessary to flatter the
leader and politician that was admittedly in him. He nearly
ran his legs off working for the company. Alfons Diruf loved
this socialist bookkeeper, after a fashion.</p>

<p>Inspector Jordan saw however that the countless brokers were
encroaching on his territory and stirring up distrust on the part
of his better clients. He lost his interest. The directors felt
obliged to send Alfons Diruf a critical memorandum explaining
Jordan&#8217;s case, and showing that he was no longer as efficient as
he used to be.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Daniel had grown tired of his room in the attic and the society
of brush-maker Hadebusch. He announced that he was going to
move. Surrounded by a cloud of smells from boiled cabbage,
Frau Hadebusch raged about the ingratitude of man. Her shrieks
called Herr Francke and the Methodist from out their warm holes;
the brush-maker and his imbecile son also appeared in the dimly
lighted vestibule; and before these five Hogarth figures stood the
defenceless sinner, Daniel Nothafft.</p>

<p>He looked about in the suburbs of St. Mary, but found everything
too dear. He went out to New Gate, but everything was
taken. He tried the St. John district, and that pleased him best
of all. Late in the afternoon he came to a house in the Long
Row, at the entrance to which hung a &#8220;To Let&#8221; sign.</p>

<p>He pulled the bell cord, and a beautiful servant girl took him
into a room. Through the window he could look out on a garden
filled with old trees. A spinster came in, and smiled at the
pleasure he took in the room and the view.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see my sister,&#8221; she said, as he asked her about the price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p><p>She called out into the hall, and her sister, likewise an elderly
and kindly spinster, came in. They held a council, the deliberations
of which were conducted in muffled tones, and then agreed
that they would have to consult Albertina. She was the third
sister. The first tip-toed to the door and, with pointed lips,
called the name, Albertina, out into the long hall with as
much coyness as had been employed in summoning the second
sister.</p>

<p>Albertina was the youngest of the three; she was about forty.
But she had forgotten, like Jasmina and Saloma, to erase twenty
years from the calendar: all three had preserved the youthful
charm of their girlhood.</p>

<p>Albertina blushed as she looked at the young man, and her
modesty was contagious; the two sisters also blushed. She told
Daniel that they were the R&uuml;diger sisters. With that she remained
silent, and looked down as though she had divulged her
entire fate. She informed Daniel that they had decided to rent
the room to some dependable young man, because there had been
considerable petty thieving in the neighbourhood of late and they
would like to enjoy the protection of a man, for they were
entirely alone, except for the boy who tended the garden. They
told him also that they had had several offers, but that they had
declined them because they did not like the appearance of the
applicants. In affairs of this kind, indeed in everything, the
three sisters were always of like mind.</p>

<p>Fr&auml;ulein Saloma asked Daniel what he did. He replied that he
was a musician. A chorus of surprise greeted his ears, rendered
in perfect time by the three female voices. Fr&auml;ulein Jasmina
asked him whether he was a singer or a violinist. He replied that
he was neither, that he was a composer, or that he at least hoped
to become one. With that an expression of intense spirituality
spread over the faces of the sisters, so that they looked like
triplets. Aha, a creative artist! &#8220;Y-e-s,&#8221; said Daniel, &#8220;if you
wish to put it that way: a creative artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>They hopped into the corner like so many sparrows, and went
into serious conference. Fr&auml;ulein Saloma, as chairman, wanted to
know whether a monthly rent of twelve marks would be too much.
No, replied Daniel, that would not be excessive. He said it
without giving the matter the slightest consideration, and then
shook hands with the sisters. Fr&auml;ulein Jasmina added that he
could use the piano on the first floor whenever he wished to, and
that it merely needed tuning. Daniel shook her hand again, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>time with special warmth. His joy had awakened in him a
measure of clumsy familiarity.</p>

<p>Before he left the house he went out into the garden, and
stood for a while under one of the trees. A tree to myself at
last, he thought. Up in the top a blackbird was singing. Meta
the servant looked out from the door where she was standing,
astonished at it all.</p>

<p>Fr&auml;ulein Albertina said to her sisters: &#8220;He seems like an interesting
young man, but he has bad manners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Artists attach no importance to externalities,&#8221; replied Fr&auml;ulein
Jasmina with knitted brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great mistake. He always looked as if he had just come
out of a bandbox. You remember, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other two nodded. The three then walked down the garden
path, arm in arm.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Daniel was standing in the vegetable market before the Goose
Man Fountain, eating apples.</p>

<p>The sun was shining, and he noticed that the shadow of the
fountain was moving slowly toward the church. It made him sad
to see that time was passing and how it was passing. When he
turned around, however, and saw that the bronze figure of the
man with the two geese under his arms was not merely indifferent
to the passing of time but confident that all is well, he could not
help but laugh.</p>

<p>What made him laugh was partly the calm of the man: he
was always waiting for something, and he was always there. He
was likewise amused at the thought that two geese could make a man
look so contented.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>As Daniel was going home one afternoon from a piano lesson,
he met Eleanore Jordan. He told her about his new room and the
three bizarre creatures in the house in the Long Row.</p>

<p>Eleanore had heard all about them. She said they were the
daughters of the geometrician R&uuml;diger, and that he had left the
town some time ago because of a quarrel with the citizens, or
rather with one of the gilds. The origin of the trouble was the
picture of a certain painter. More she did not know, other than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>that R&uuml;diger had gone to Switzerland and lost his life by falling
down one of the mountains. The sisters, she said, were the laughing
stock of the town. They never left the house except on
certain days, when they went out to the nearby cemetery at the
Church of St. John to place flowers on the grave of that painter.</p>

<p>Daniel hardly listened to what she said. They were standing
at the St. Sebaldus Church, and the chimes began to play.
&#8220;Magnificent,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;an ascending triad in A.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore asked him how he was getting along, and looked with
regret at his sunken cheeks. Her virile expression was rather displeasing
to him. He was surprised to see how rarely she lowered
her eye lids. He said he was getting along quite well. She
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s terrible that a man has to have a monster in his body
that must be fed,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Otherwise one could storm the
heavens and steal the songs of the angels. But this was not to be.
You have first to flutter your wings until they are wounded and
break your chains, and by that time such ethereal power as you
may have had is dissipated.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wrinkled his face until he again looked like the wily ape.
&#8220;But I am going to see it through,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to find out
whether God drew me from the urn as a blank or a prize.&#8221; He
could be very eloquent when he talked about himself.</p>

<p>Eleanore smiled. It seemed to her that it was merely necessary
to bring a little order into his life. She consequently assumed
the responsibility of looking after his room.</p>

<p>In Tetzel Street they met the inspector. As Jordan walked
along at the side of his beloved daughter, it seemed to him that
the grey walls and weather-beaten stones of the houses were no
longer so earthy or weighed down with time. Eleanore looked toward
the West into the purple glow of the setting sun. She
was not quite herself. There came moments when she suffered
from homesickness for a fairer land.</p>

<p>She thought of Italy. She conjured up lovely visions of
sunny bays, blooming groves, and white statues.</p>

<p>Daniel however went on toward the F&uuml;ll. The workmen were
coming from the suburbs, and in their tired faces he felt that he
recognised his own world. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;I should like to
get nearer the stars, to make the acquaintance of more dependable
hearts, of hearts that are truer even than my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then he looked up at Benda&#8217;s window, and saw his light.
He was ashamed of himself.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p><h3>V</h3>

<p>The first time Eleanore visited Daniel it was along toward
evening. She heard from a distance the piano and the shrill
crowing of Daniel&#8217;s voice. Down in the hall she saw three white
figures cuddled up close to each other like hens on a roost.</p>

<p>It was the R&uuml;diger sisters trying to drink in the creative efforts
of the artist. That they were eavesdropping at the fount of
art they understood both in the good and the bad sense: their
enthusiasm was praiseworthy, their courtesy was deficient. When
they caught sight of Eleanore on the stairway, they were terrified,
and rustled into the adjoining room.</p>

<p>The three elderly hearts beat impetuously. It was Jasmina&#8217;s
turn to read from R&uuml;ckert&#8217;s poems. Jasmina had not the shadow
of a desire to perform; her sisters were equally disinclined to
listen.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not right,&#8221; the three kept saying, when they heard of
Eleanore&#8217;s visits. &#8220;It is not right.&#8221; Even Meta the maid was of
the opinion that her calls were highly unconventional.</p>

<p>As Daniel played on and merely nodded to her, Eleanore&#8217;s eyes
fell on the mask of Zingarella. She stepped up, took it down
from the nail on the wall, and examined it in perfect silence.</p>

<p>Daniel had in the meantime left the piano. A loud cry from
him startled her: &#8220;What the devil are you doing?&#8221; he exclaimed
in a tone of immoderate anger. He took the mask, which she
was handling so lightly and tremulously, out of her hands, and
replaced it on the nail with affectionate care.</p>

<p>The sensitive girl at once began to cry. She turned to one
side in order to conceal her tears. Daniel was irritated, but the
first thought that occurred to him was how he could make amends
for his rudeness. He fetched a worn book, and offered to lend
it to her. It was a translation of that beautiful old novel,
&#8220;Manon Lescaut.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore came frequently after office hours, but never remained
long; she did not wish to make the people at home uneasy.
During the short time she stayed she always found a number of
things to do, such as straightening up the papers on his table or
arranging his scores.</p>

<p>She became acquainted with Benda; he took a liking to her.
It did him good merely to be in her presence, and he could
not understand why she did not have the same wholesome effect
on Daniel. Daniel seemed thoroughly unappreciative of the girl.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>He was like a man who goes along the street carrying a basket
full of eggs: his sole ambition for the time being is to see that not
a single egg is lost or broken.</p>

<p>The two would frequently accompany the girl home. Daniel
always talked about himself, and Benda listened with a smile. Or
Benda talked about Daniel, and Daniel was all ears.</p>

<p>What did people say? That Eleanore was now trotting around
with three men, whereas she formerly had only one on her string,
the Baron, and that you are going to hear from this affair.</p>

<p>Every now and then a snip of ugly gossip reached Eleanore&#8217;s
ears. She paid not the slightest attention to it. She looked out
from her glass case on to the world with cool and cheerful
indifference, quite incapable of placing the established interpretation
on the glances of calumniators.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Benda could have sketched Daniel&#8217;s face in the darkness: the
round forehead, the little nose, pointed and mulish, the rigidly
pinched lips, the angular musician&#8217;s chin, and the deep dimples
in his cheeks.</p>

<p>His ignorance of the musician was complete. Like all scholars,
he nurtured an ingrained distrust when it came to the supernatural
influence of art. For the great musical compositions which, in the
course of time and as a result of the homage of succeeding generations,
had come to be regarded as exemplary and incontestable,
he had a feeling of reverence. For the creations of his contemporaries
he had no ear.</p>

<p>That it was hard to understand and appreciate, he knew.
That it was bitter not to be understood or appreciated, he had
experienced. That the discipline associated with all intellectual
work demands its tribute in the form of sacrificial renunciation
needed no proof in his case.</p>

<p>The musician was something new to him. How did he regard
him? As a blind man whose soul was on fire. As a drunken
man who made the impression of repulsive sobriety on other men.
As an obsessed individual who was living an excruciatingly lonely
life and was unaware of it. As an unpolished peasant with the
nerves of a degenerate.</p>

<p>The scientist wished to find the established and formulated law
in the musician&mdash;a task that could lead only to despair. The friend
surveyed the life of his friend; he allowed the personalities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>many young men whom he had met in life to pass before his mind&#8217;s
eye. He looked for the criteria of common interests; he sought
a law, even here. He sat in the dusk, and read from the works
of the philosopher Mainl&auml;nder. Then he laid the book to one side,
and said to himself: &#8220;The youth of to-day are lacerating, devastating
themselves.... It is a fearful age. Measure, proportion, and
balance are gone. Every model becomes a caricature. The individual
is absolutely dependent upon himself. The flame is without
container, and threatens to burn the hand that would check it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Daniel he had found his brother in fate. Music became his
brother in torture. On seeing his friend lacerated and devastated,
he saw twitch from the eye of Gorgo herself the profoundest
of wisdom. But he did not lay bare his own heart.</p>

<p>One night, after unending conversation had brought them both
to silence&mdash;like ships which, tossed about by the winds, at last
drift into the harbour&mdash;Benda, taking up with an angry, exasperated
remark by Daniel as it echoed back from the other shore of this
silence, said: &#8220;We must not be vain. We dare not usurp a
privilege which has no other basis than our inner task. We must
never stand before our own picture. It seems to me that an
artist should be of exalted modesty, and that without this modesty
he is nothing but a more or less remarkable lout.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel looked up at once. Benda&#8217;s big teeth were visible under
his bushy moustache. He had a habit of pulling his lips apart
whenever he was searching for a really incisive word.</p>

<p>Benda continued: &#8220;The great majority of what you call talent
is ignominious. Talent is a feather duster. All that comes from
the finger tips is evil. The man who has a distinct goal and is willing
to suffer in order to reach it, that man we can use. And
otherwise&mdash;how beautiful it all is after all! Heaven is above
us, the earth is beneath us, and in between stands immortal
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel got up, and seized Benda&#8217;s hand. There was nothing more
vanquishing than Benda&#8217;s handshake. His good strong right became
a vise in which he shook a man&#8217;s hand until it became limp,
a perfectly delightful benevolence radiating from his eyes in the
meanwhile.</p>

<p>The two men exchanged the fraternal &#8220;thou.&#8221;</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Eleanore returned the copy of &#8220;Manon Lescaut.&#8221; When Daniel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>asked her how she liked it, she never said a word. Since he thought
that it was an excellent book, he began to scold.</p>

<p>She said: &#8220;I cannot read books in which there is so much talk
about love.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gazed into space in order to allow her voice time to die
away. There was a violin tone in her speech, the charm of which
he could not escape. When he fully realised what she had said,
he laughed a short laugh, and remarked that her attitude was
one of affected coyness. She shook her head. Then he teased
her about going with young Auffenberg, and asked her whether
real love affairs were just as disagreeable to her as those related
in novels.</p>

<p>The flaming blue of her eyes compelled him to look down.
It was not pleasant for him to admit, by action, that the expression
in her face was stronger than his own. She left, and did not
allow herself to be seen for a few days.</p>

<p>When she returned, he was na&iuml;ve enough to renew his banter.
She took her seat on the corner sofa, and looked straight into his
face: &#8220;Do we really intend to remain friends, Daniel?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>He cast a side glance of amazement at her, not because he was
particularly struck by her charming suavity and marked winsomeness,
but rather because the violin tone in her throat resounded more
strongly and clearly than ever. But it was quite impossible for
him to give an affirmative reply to her question without puckering
up his lips and putting his hands in his trouser pockets.</p>

<p>She said she had no desire to seem important in his estimation,
that she merely wanted him to regard her as different from other
girls. She insisted that he concede her one privilege if they were
to remain friends: he was not to talk to her about love, either
seriously or in jest. She remarked that for months the very
word love had called up ghost-like recollections. Why this was so,
she said she could not tell him, not now, perhaps years from now
when both had grown old. She could not do it, for if she
endeavoured to refresh old memories or revive what she had half
forgotten, her whole past arose before her, flat, languid, and
insipid, easily misinterpreted by the person who heard the story,
however clear it might be to her. She repeated that this was the
way it was, and she could not help it. Once again she asked
that he spare her feelings on this point.</p>

<p>Her face took on a serious expression; it resembled an old
picture. There was something dream-like in her words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;Well, if that is all you have on your mind, Eleanore, I am
sure that it will be easy for me to respect your wish,&#8221; said Daniel.
There was a manifest lack of feeling in the kindness he displayed.
It seemed indeed that the secret to which she was attaching so
much importance was far removed from his egotistically encircled
world. The little fountain in the garden was rustling. He
listened to see if he could not catch the dominating tone in the
continual splashing.</p>

<p>Eleanore turned to him now with renewed if not novel candour.
She was closer to him in every way&mdash;her eyes, her hands, and
her words.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Daniel had just completed an orchestral work which he had
entitled &#8220;Vineta.&#8221; He wished to have Benda hear it. One
evening about six Benda came in. Everything was ready. Daniel
sat down at the piano. His face was pale, his smooth upper lip
was trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now think of the sea; think of a storm; think of a boat with
people in it. Picture to yourself a wonderful <i>aurora borealis</i> and
a sunken city rising from the sea. Imagine a sea that had suddenly
become calm, and in the light a strange phenomenon. Conjure up
such a scene before your mind&#8217;s eye, or conjure up something
totally different, for this is a false way of getting at the meaning
of music. It is plain prostitution to think anything of the kind.
Ice-flat.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was just about to begin, when some one knocked at the door.
Eleanore entered. She whisked across the room, and took her
seat on the sofa.</p>

<p>The piece opened with a quiet rhythmical, mournful movement,
which suddenly changed to a raging presto. The melodic figure
was shattered like a bouquet of flowers in a waterfall almost before
it had had time to take shape and display real composure. The
dissipated elements, scattered to the four corners of the earth, then
returned, hesitatingly and with evident contrition, to be reunited
in a single chain. It seemed that the mad whirlwind had left
them richer, purer and more spiritual. They pealed forth now,
one after the other, in a slow-moving decrescendo, until they constituted
a solemn chorus played in moderato, melting at last into
the lovely and serious main theme, which in the finale streamed
away and beyond into infinity, dying out on an arpeggiated chord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p><p>Where the piano failed to produce the full effect, Daniel helped
out with his crow-like voice. It was the uncanny energy of
expression that prevented his singing from having a comic effect.</p>

<p>Benda&#8217;s eyes were so strained in the effort to listen intelligently
and appreciatively that they became dazed, glazed. Had he been
asked he could not have said whether the work was a success or a
failure. The feature of the performance that convinced him was
the man and the magnetism that radiated from the man. The
work itself he could neither fathom nor evaluate. It took hold
of him nevertheless because of its inseparable association with
the human phenomenon.</p>

<p>Daniel got up, stumbled over to the sofa, buried his face in
his hands, and sighed: &#8220;Do you feel it? Do you really feel it?&#8221;
He then rose, lunged at the piano, seized the score, and hurled it
to the floor: &#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s no account; it is nothing; it is an abominable
botch.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw himself on the sofa a second time. Eleanore, sitting
perfectly motionless in the other corner, looked at him with the
eyes of an astonished child.</p>

<p>Benda had gone to the window, and was looking out into the
trees and the grey clouds of the sky. Then he turned around.
&#8220;That something must be done for you and your cause is clear,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>Eleanore stretched out her arms toward Benda as though she
wished to thank him. Her lips began to move. But when she
saw Daniel she did not dare to say a word, until she suddenly
exclaimed: &#8220;Heavens, there are two buttons on his vest which are
hanging by a thread.&#8221; She ran out of the room. In a few
moments she returned with needle and thread, which she had
had Meta give her, sat down at Daniel&#8217;s side, and sewed the
buttons on.</p>

<p>Benda had to laugh. But what she did had a tranquilising
effect; she seemed to enable life to win the victory over the
insidious pranks of apparitions.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>In years gone by, Benda had known the theatrical manager and
impresario D&ouml;rmaul. He went to D&ouml;rmaul now, and took Daniel&#8217;s
new work along with him; for the versatile parvenu, who always
had a number of irons in the fire, also published music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p><p>A few weeks elapsed before Benda heard from D&ouml;rmaul: &#8220;Incomprehensible
stuff! Crazy attempt to be original! You couldn&#8217;t
coax a dog away from the stove with it.&#8221; Such was D&ouml;rmaul&#8217;s
opinion.</p>

<p>A young man with fiery red hair followed Benda to the door
and spoke to him. He said his name was Wurzelmann and that
he was a musician himself; that he had attended the Vienna Conservatory,
where his teacher had given him a letter of recommendation
to Alexander D&ouml;rmaul. He also told Benda that D&ouml;rmaul
was planning to form an opera company that would visit the
smaller cities of the provinces, and that he was to be the Kapellmeister.</p>

<p>He spoke in the detestable idiom of the Oriental Jew. Benda
was politely cold.</p>

<p>The main point was still to come: &#8220;Vineta&#8221; had aroused Wurzelmann&#8217;s
profound admiration; he had read the score on the side:
&#8220;A great talent, Doctor, a talent such as we have not had for a
long, long while,&#8221; said Wurzelmann.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but what am I to say about Herr D&ouml;rmaul&#8217;s opinion?&#8221;
asked Benda. He found it difficult to trust the man before him,
and was using the judgment of the man behind him as a foil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know D&ouml;rmaul? I thought you did. Whenever
he has no authority to fear he becomes very bold. Lay the Ninth
Symphony before him without Beethoven&#8217;s name to it, and he will
tell you at once that it is rubbish. Do you want to bet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honestly?&#8221; asked Benda, somewhat concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me the score, and I&#8217;ll promise you to arouse the least
sensitive from their lethargy with it. With a work of that kind
you have got to blow the trumpet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benda thought it over. He had no use for trumpet-blowing,
and no confidence in those who did the blowing. And yet he
consented, for he did not feel justified in arbitrarily depriving
Daniel of a chance.</p>

<p>It turned out that Wurzelmann had told the truth. A fortnight
later Daniel was informed that the Orchestral Union had decided
to perform his work in February. In order to provide its hearers
with a more elaborate picture of his creative ability, the Union
asked him for a second work. His compositions were perfect;
others needed revision.</p>

<p>Wurzelmann boasted of having won his way to the seats of the
mighty. He had the cordial approval of such professors of music
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>as Wackerbarth and Herold. His masterpiece of diplomacy lay
in the fact that he had secured Andreas D&ouml;derlein as director of
the orchestra.</p>

<p>His store of suggestions was inexhaustible, his plans without
number. He mentioned the fact that when the company was
on the road they would have to have a second Kapellmeister, since
he himself would have to function at times as substitute director:
&#8220;Leave it all to me, dear Nothafft,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Alexander D&ouml;rmaul
has got to dance to my tune, and my tune is this: It is Nothafft
or nobody for Kapellmeister.&#8221;</p>

<p>If he began with humility, he concluded with familiarity.
Daniel hated red-headed people, particularly when they had inflamed
eyes and slobbered when they spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is an unappetising fellow, your Wurzelmann,&#8221; he said to
Benda, &#8220;and it is embarrassing to me to be indebted to him. He
imagines he flatters me when he speaks contemptibly of himself.
What he deserves is a kick or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benda was silent. Touched by Wurzelmann&#8217;s devoted efforts,
he had called him <i>servule</i>, or the &#8220;little slave.&#8221; It was pleasant
to think that there was some one to remove the stumbling blocks
from the road, so that the feet of him who had risen from obscurity
might find a place to walk. But the little slave was filled with
the admiration of the Jew, born in poverty and oppression, for the
genius of the other race.</p>

<p>Benda knew this. He was uneasy at the thought of it; for
other and no less disingenuous fanatics regarded Wurzelmann&#8217;s
behaviour merely as a racial peculiarity.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Summer with its hot August days had come. The two friends
took frequent walks out to the suburbs, strolling through the forests
of Feucht and Fischbach, or climbing the high hills about the city.</p>

<p>Eleanore joined them on one of these excursions. It was a joy
to see her drink in the fragrance of the flowers and the fir trees
or study the various cloud formations and the alternating scenes of
the landscape. When she did this she was like a bird gliding
along on noiseless wing in the upper regions, far removed from
the grime of the earth, bathing in the undefiled air of the clouds.</p>

<p>She listened to the conversation of the friends with intelligent
attention. A piercing glance or a wrinkle of the brow showed
that she was taking sides, and accepting or rejecting in her own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>mind the views that were being set forth. If she was moved to
express an opinion of her own, she generally hit the nail on the
head.</p>

<p>As they were returning home, night set in. The sky was clear;
the stars were shining. There were a great number of falling
stars. Eleanore remarked that she really did not have as many
wishes as she could express under these circumstances. The erudite
Benda replied with a smile that in these August nights there were
frequently so many groups of asteroids that the whole firmament
seemed to be in motion, and that one could easily grow tired of
so many wishes.</p>

<p>Eleanore wanted to know what an asteroid was. Benda explained
it to her as well as he could. Then he told her all about constellations
and the milky way, and explained to her that the latter
consists of millions of individual stars. He also spoke of the size
of the stars; and since he referred to them occasionally as suns
and worlds, she became somewhat sceptical, and asked him whether
there were any earths among the stars. &#8220;Earths? What do you
mean by earths?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Why, earths, just like the one we
live on,&#8221; she replied. Having been told that there were earths
among the stars, Eleanore raised a number of rather cleverly
framed questions about the trees and animals and people that might
be found on these other earths. She was told that it was highly
probable that they were all inhabited about as our own: &#8220;Why
should this globe enjoy special privileges?&#8221; he asked. He added,
however, that even if the inhabitants of the other earths did not
have the same mental faculties that we have, they were at least
beings endowed with reason and instinct.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to tell me that such people as you and Daniel
and I may be living up there in those starry regions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that there are countless peoples and humanities up among
the stars of whom we know nothing at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore sat down on a milestone by the roadside, gazed out
into space with trembling lips, and broke out crying. Benda took
her hand, and caressed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am awfully sorry for all those peoples up there,&#8221; Eleanore
sobbed, looked up, smiled, and let the tears take their course.
Benda would have liked to take Daniel by the arm, and shout into
his ear: &#8220;Look at her now!&#8221; Daniel was looking at her, but he did
not see her.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p><h3>XI</h3>

<p>One evening in October, Inspector Jordan left his house in
Broad Street, buttoned his top coat more closely about him, and
walked hastily through a connecting alley that was so narrow that
it seemed as if some one had taken a big knife and cut the houses
in two. His goal was Carolina Street. It was late, and he was
hungry. Doubting whether Gertrude would have a warm supper
ready for him, he went to an inn.</p>

<p>He had spent two full hours there trying to get a rich hops
dealer to take out some insurance. The man had him explain
over and over again the advantages of insurance, studied the tables
backwards and forwards, and yet he was unable to come to a
decision. Then the waiter brought him his dinner. There he
sat, smacking his lips with the noise of human contentment, his
great white napkin tied under his chin in such a fashion that the
two corners of it stuck out on either side of his massive head,
giving the appearance of two white ears. He had offended Jordan&#8217;s
social instincts: he had not thought it worth while to wait
for an invitation.</p>

<p>Among other guests in the inn was Bonengel, the barber. He
recognised Jordan and spoke to him. He took a seat in the background,
picked out the ugliest and greasiest of the waitresses, and
ordered a bulky portion of sausage and sauerkraut.</p>

<p>He told lascivious anecdotes. When the waitress brought him
his food, she tittered, and said: &#8220;He is a jolly good fellow, Bonengel
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jordan began to eat rapidly, but soon lost his appetite, pushed
his plate to one side, propped his chin on his hands, and stared at
the immobile clouds of tobacco smoke before him.</p>

<p>He had a feeling that it was no longer possible to keep at this
work day after day, year in and year out. Running from one end
of the city to the other, up and down the same stairs, through
the same old streets&mdash;he could not do it. Answering the same
questions, making the same assertions, refuting the same objections,
praising the same plan in the same words, feigning the same interest
and quieting the same distrust day after day&mdash;no, he could not do
it. Disturbing the same people in their domestic peace, prodding
himself on to new effort every morning, listening to the same
curtain lectures of that monster of monsters, the insatiate stock
market, and standing up under the commands of his chief, Alfons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>Diruf&mdash;no, he was no longer equal to it. It was all contrary to
the dignity of a man of his years.</p>

<p>He was ashamed of himself; and he was fearfully tired.</p>

<p>He thought of his past life. He recalled how he had risen
from poverty, and worked up to the position of a highly respected
merchant. That was when he was in Ulm. There he had married
Agnes, the blond daughter of the railroad engineer.</p>

<p>But why had he never become rich? Other men who were distinctly
inferior to him in shrewdness, diligence, and polish were
now wealthy; he was poor. Three times he had been threatened
with bankruptcy, and three times friends had come to his rescue.
Then a partner joined him, invested some capital in the firm, and
the business was once more on its feet.</p>

<p>But it turned out that this partner was a stranger to loyalty
and quite without conscience. &#8220;Jordan is a drag on the business,&#8221;
he would say to his customers, &#8220;Jordan is stupid, Jordan cannot
make a calculation.&#8221; And the partner never rested until Jordan
was paid a set sum and eased out of the firm.</p>

<p>He then tried his fortune here and there for eight or nine
years. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Jordan,&#8221; said Agnes, &#8220;everything will come
out well.&#8221; But it did not. Whatever Jordan took hold of, he
took hold of at the wrong end at the wrong time with the wrong
people.</p>

<p>He could not get on. Not only because his hand was heavy
and his head too honest, but because he had allowed himself to
be befooled by a chimera.</p>

<p>Early in life he had had a dream, and all his enterprise and
industry were directed toward the fulfilment of this dream. It
had been impossible: he had never been able to save up enough
money. Every time he discussed his favourite wish with Agnes,
and told her about the happy days when he would be able to live
his own life and be his own boss, she encouraged him and tried to
help him. But it seemed now that she had known all along that
he had merely been dreaming, and that her magnanimity had
prompted her not to jolt him out of his delusion.</p>

<p>It had always seemed to him that the world of dolls was a
world in itself. He had taken an enchanted delight in picturing
the types of faces, clothes, and hair he would design for his
various dolls, big and little. Dolls of the most variegated charm
peopled his fancy: there were princesses of different degrees of
proximity to the throne, fisher maids and mermaids; there were
shepherds and shepherdesses, Casperls and lusty imps, dolls with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>heads of porcelain and dolls with heads of wax, all so faithfully
imitated that it would require anthropomorphic skill to detect
that they were not human beings. Their hair was, of course, to
be human hair. Some of them were to wear the costumes of
foreign races, while others were to be dressed up like fairy figures,
sprites, and gnomes. There was to be a Haroun al Raschid and
an Oriental Dervish.</p>

<p>The last time he moved his choice fell on Nuremberg. He was
attracted to Nuremberg because it was the centre of the doll
industry.</p>

<p>About this time Agnes died, and he was left alone with the
three children for whom he had to make a living. He no longer
had the courage to hope for success or prosperity; even the doll
factory had become a chimera. He had but one ambition: he
wished to lay aside ten thousand marks for each of his three daughters,
so that they would be provided for in any event after his
death. The boy, he thought, could take care of himself.</p>

<p>Up to the present, however, he had not been able to place the
half of this sum in the bank. And now, suppose he lost his position;
suppose the frailties of old age prevented him from making
his own living; suppose he was obliged to draw on the savings of
years for his own support. How could he look his daughters
in the face in the evening of his earthly life?</p>

<p>&#8220;The slag hid behind something in the cellar, and when his
wife tried to bring him his pants, she let them fall in the flour
bin.&#8221; This elegant remark emanated from Bonengel the barber.</p>

<p>His auditors gurgled, the waitress roared.</p>

<p>As Jordan walked home he could hear above the wind the voice
of Bonengel the barber. It sounded like the rattling of a pair of
hair-clippers.</p>

<p>He disliked walking up the steps to his front door; they were
so narrow; they creaked as though they were ready to fall down;
and he was always afraid he would meet some blind people. An
oculist lived on the first floor, and he had often seen sightless persons
feeling their way around.</p>

<p>A letter was lying on his table. The cover bore the address of
the General Agency of the Prudentia Insurance Co. He walked
up and down a while before opening it. It was his discharge
papers.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p><h3>XII</h3>

<p>Friedrich Benda became more and more dejected. He saw
that as a private individual he would have to waste energy that
should be going into his profession. It seemed to him that he was
condemned to bury his talent in eternal obscurity.</p>

<p>He broke off from the most of his acquaintances; with others
he quit corresponding. If friends spoke to him on the street, he
turned his head. His sense of honour had been wounded; he
was on the point of losing his self-respect.</p>

<p>Daniel was the only one who failed to notice the change that
was coming over him. Probably he had accustomed himself to the
belief that Benda&#8217;s life was orderly and agreeable. The plebeian
prosperity of the family in which he himself lived probably made
him feel that that was the way his friend was living. At all
events he never asked any questions, and was never once struck by
the fact that Benda would sit before him for hours with his face
wrapped in bitter, melancholy gloom.</p>

<p>Benda smiled at Daniel&#8217;s na&iuml;vet&eacute;; for he felt that his attitude
was due to na&iuml;vet&eacute; and nothing more. He harboured no resentment.
He decided not to say a word about his condition to Daniel,
then all taken up with himself and his music. It was, however,
at times impossible for him to prevent his smarting and his desire
to put an end to his ineffectual existence from breaking through
the coating of reserve in which he had encased himself.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of a dismal day, Benda called for Daniel
just as he was finishing one of his piano lessons. The two friends
decided to take a walk and then dine together at Benda&#8217;s.</p>

<p>In the hallway they met the R&uuml;diger sisters as they were returning
from their daily stroll through the garden. Benda greeted
them with an antiquated politeness; Daniel just barely touched
the rim of his hat. The sisters lined up as if ready for a cotillion,
and returned the greetings with infinite grace. Fr&auml;ulein Jasmina
let a rose fall, and when Benda picked it up for her, she pressed
her hand against her scarcely noticeable breast and gave voice to
her gratitude, again with infinite grace.</p>

<p>When they reached the street, Benda said in a tone of compassion:
&#8220;They are three delicate creatures; they live their lonely
lives like vestal virgins guarding a sacred fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel smiled. &#8220;Yes, a sacred fire? Do you refer to the
incident with the painter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do; and he was no ordinary painter, either, let me tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>you. I heard the whole story the other day. The painter was
Anselm Feuerbach.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel knew nothing whatever about Anselm Feuerbach. He
was impressed, however, by the name, which, by virtue of a mysterious
magic, struck his ear like the chime of a noble bell. &#8220;Tell
me about him,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The story was as follows: Four years before his death, that is,
six years ago, Anselm Feuerbach came to Nuremberg for the last
time to visit his mother. He was already sick in body and soul,
and was much disappointed in his alleged friends. The incessant
torture resulting from lack of appreciation had told on his health.
A few of the more enlightened citizens, however, recalled his
fame, as it floated about in the heavy air of Germany, somewhat
befogged and quite expatriated, and the Chamber of Commerce
placed an order with Feuerbach for a painting to be hung in the
Palace of Justice. Feuerbach accepted the order, choosing as his
theme Emperor Ludwig in the act of conferring on the citizens
of Nuremberg the right to free trade. When the picture was
completed, there was a great deal of dissatisfaction with it. The
merchants had expected something totally different: they had
looked for a cheap but striking canvas after the style of Kreling,
and not this dignified, classical work by Feuerbach.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. The hanging space was so small that several
inches of the canvas had to be run into the wall, and the light
was wretched. The Chamber of Commerce proceeded at once to
make trouble with regard to the paying of Feuerbach&#8217;s bill. An
ugly quarrel arose in which R&uuml;diger, the geometrician, who had
always been an ardent champion of Feuerbach, took the artist&#8217;s
part. It finally reached the point where R&uuml;diger left the city,
swearing he would never return. His daughters had all three loved
Feuerbach from the time he lived in their father&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact, if there ever was an amiable artist,&#8221; Benda
said in conclusion, &#8220;it was Anselm Feuerbach. Would you like to
see him? Come, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were near the Cemetery of St. John. The gate was open,
and Daniel followed Benda. They walked along a narrow path,
until Benda pointed to a flat stone bearing the name of Albrecht
D&uuml;rer. After this they came to Feuerbach&#8217;s grave. A bronze
tablet, already quite darkened with age and weather, bore Feuerbach&#8217;s
face in profile. Beneath it lay a laurel wreath, the withered
leaves of which were fluttering in the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;What a life he lived!&#8221; said Benda in a low tone. &#8220;And what
a death he died! The death of a hunted dog!&#8221;</p>

<p>As they walked back to the city, night came on. Daniel had
removed his hat, and was walking along at Benda&#8217;s side looking
straight ahead. Benda was as nervous as he had ever been in
his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;A German life, and a German death,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;He
stretched out his hand to give, and the people spat in it. He gives
and gives and gives, and they take and take and take, without
gratitude, yea, rather with, scorn. The only thing they study is
their consanguinity table. They make the microscope and the
catechism copulate; their philosophy and their police systems live
in <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>. Good demeanour they know not; of human agreements
they have never heard. They decide to do something, and
they do it. That is all. There is no longer a place for me in
Germany. I am leaving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to leave? Where are you going?&#8221; asked Daniel,
in faithful amazement. Benda bit his lips, and was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see these big white spots here? They have neither
mountains nor rivers on them. Those are places that have never
been trod upon by European feet. There is where I am going.&#8221;
He smiled a gentle smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really? When?&#8221; asked Daniel, filled with dismay at the
thought of losing his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not decided when, but it will be soon. I have work to
do over there. I need air, room, sky, the free animal and the
free plant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benda&#8217;s mother came in. She was rather tall, walked with the
difficulties of age, had sharp features and deep-set eyes.</p>

<p>She looked first at her son and then at Daniel. Then her eyes
fell on the atlas and remained fixed upon it, filled with an expression
of horror and anxiety.</p>

<p>Daniel did not know what to say. Benda, still smiling to himself,
began to talk about other things.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>At the death of her mother, Gertrude Jordan was nine years
old. She had crept into the death chamber and sat by the bier
for three hours. Perhaps her seclusion from the world and association
with people dated from that hour. As she was leaving the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>death room, the clock on the wall struck, and a cock crowed in the
distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you tick, clock?&#8221; she asked in a loud voice, &#8220;why do
you crow, cock?&#8221; And again: &#8220;Who makes you tick, clock, who
makes you crow, cock?&#8221;</p>

<p>She had grown up, and no one knew anything about her. It
was even difficult for her own father to approach her; how she
was constituted, mentally and spiritually, he did not know. She
never associated with girls of her own age. Her dark eyes glowed
with wrath when she heard the senseless, sensuous laughter of
other girls.</p>

<p>The first time she partook of the holy communion she swooned
and had to be carried out. Jordan then took her to Pommersfelden
to his sister, the widow of the district physician Kupferschmied.
At the end of one week she returned alone, completely
broken in spirit. She had seen a calf slaughtered; the sight had
made her almost insane.</p>

<p>From the time she was fifteen years old she had insisted on
having her own bed room. When she was sixteen she demanded
that the maid be discharged; she herself did all the cooking and
kept house. As soon as she had finished her work, she would take
her seat by the quilting frame.</p>

<p>Through her father, Benjamin Dorn had come into the family.
Gertrude liked him because Eleanore made fun of him. He did
not seem to her like a man; he reminded her rather of the languishing
angels she embroidered. He brought her all his religious
tracts and edifying pamphlets, but she could not grasp the language.
He took her to the Methodist revivals, but the noisy gnashing of
teeth at these meetings terrified her, and after a few times it was
impossible to persuade her to go back. He also recommended that
she read the Bible, but she could find nothing in it that brought
her peace of mind. It seemed that she had a wound in her soul
that would not heal. Long after she had abandoned Benjamin
Dorn and his cheap sanctimoniousness, he imagined that she still
loved him and looked up to him. She managed, however, to come
into his presence only on the rarest occasions, and then she never
spoke to him.</p>

<p>Divine worship in the Protestant church seemed to her like a
sort of bargain day on which the people assembled to do business
with Heaven instead of on work days. She missed the dignity;
the sermons left her cold; the ritual made not the slightest appeal
to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p><p>She never heard from any one at any time a single sentence that
really enlightened her or remained fixed in her memory. It was
the jejune insipidity of an entire age, the stale flatness of the
world that she felt to the very depths of her soul. If she wished
to make her heart glow, if she became unusually fearful of the
empty air and the empty day, she stole secretly into the Church
of Our Lady or into St. Sebaldus, where the house of God was
more solemnly decorated, where there were more lights burning,
where the prayers had a more mysterious sound, the priests seemed
to be more affected by what they were doing, and where the worshipper
could sense the awful meaning of life and death.</p>

<p>All external beauty, however, was repulsive to her. She hated
even beautiful scenery and fair weather, regarding them as temptations
to mortal man intended to lead him into some sort of folly.
She loved nothing about herself, neither her face nor her voice.
She was indeed frightened at the sound of her own deep voice.
She did not like her hair, nor had she any use for her hands.</p>

<p>One winter evening she took from her hand the gold ring, an
heirloom from her mother, presented to her by her father, and
threw it into the creek. Then she bowed down over the ledge,
and seemed to feel as if she had relieved her soul of a great
burden.</p>

<p>Eleanore tried time and time again to come near her sister, but
each time she was thrust back. Though Gertrude never conversed
with people, every word that was said about Eleanore reached her
ears; she felt ashamed of her sister. She could not bear the
looks of Eleanore, took an intense dislike to her, and in the end
was obliged to summon all her courage in order to return her
greeting. It was impossible for her, however, to reproach Eleanore;
for that she did not have sufficient command of language. In
truth, her control of words was exceedingly limited. Everything,
grief as well as injustice, she was forced to stifle within her own
soul. She grieved about Eleanore, and became at the same time
more and more nervous and excited. It seemed that something
about her sister was tantalising her, drawing her on, worrying her,
making her lose sleep.</p>

<p>Her restlessness became so great that she could no longer sit
at the quilting frame; in fact, it was no longer possible for her
to do any kind of exacting work. Something drew her out of the
house, and once she was away, something forthwith drew her
back home. Her heart beat violently when she was alone, and
yet, if her father or brother or Eleanore came in, she could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>stand their presence, and took refuge in her own room. If it was
hot, she closed the windows; if it was cold, she opened them and
leaned out. If it was quiet, she was filled with fear; if it was not
quiet, she longed for peace. She could not say her prayers; she
had none to say; her mind and soul were muted, muffled, dumb.
She felt the hours following each other in regular order as something
terrible; she wanted to skip over years, just as one might
skip over pages of a tiresome book. And when the worst came
to the worst, and she did not know what on earth to do, she ran
to the Church of Our Lady, threw herself prostrate before the
high altar, buried her face, and remained perfectly motionless
until her soul had found greater peace.</p>

<p>Something made her go to Eleanore; she did not want to do it,
but she could not help it. She was naturally vigilant, and she
wished to ward off misfortune if possible. She was obsessed with
an uncanny feeling, a gruesome curiosity. She dogged her sister&#8217;s
steps in secret. One time she saw from a distance that Eleanore
had started off with a man who had been waiting for her. She
could not move from the spot; Eleanore caught sight of her.</p>

<p>The next day Eleanore came to her voluntarily, and told her
quite candidly of her relation to Eberhard von Auffenberg. Concerning
what she knew of Eberhard&#8217;s fate she said nothing; she
merely indicated that he was extremely unhappy. She told her
how she had met him the previous winter on the Dutzendteich at
the ice carnival, how he ran after her, how glad she was to show
him a little friendship, and how much he needed friendship.</p>

<p>Gertrude was silent for a long while. Finally she said, with a
voice so deep that it seemed to have burst from being too full:
&#8220;You two either must get married, or you must not see each other
any more. What you are doing is a crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A crime?&#8221; said Eleanore astonished, &#8220;how so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask your conscience,&#8221; was the answer, spoken with eyes riveted
on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;My conscience is quite clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have none,&#8221; said Gertrude harshly. &#8220;You lie, and
you are being lied to. You are sunk in sin; there is no hope for
you. That man&#8217;s evil looks! His ugly thoughts! And the
thoughts of the other men! They are all beyond redemption.
You are spotted through and through. You don&#8217;t know it, but
I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She got up, kicked the chair from her with her heels, and stared
at Eleanore with her mysterious black eyes: &#8220;Never mention this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>to me again,&#8221; she whispered with trembling lips, &#8220;never, never!&#8221;
With that she went out.</p>

<p>Eleanore felt something like actual loathing for her own sister.
Filled with an indescribable foreboding, she detected in Gertrude
the adversary that fate had marked out for her.</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>When the autumn days came on and it began to get cold, Daniel
was a frequent visitor at Jordan&#8217;s. Although he had a warm
stove now of his own, he took pleasure in remembering the comfortable
corner of a year ago. He had a greater affection for
things and rooms than he had for human beings.</p>

<p>It was rare that he came in contact with Jordan, for now that
he was no longer with the Prudentia, it was hard to locate him:
he was doing odd jobs for a number of concerns, and this kept
him more or less on the go. Benno came home after office hours,
only to betake himself to his room, where he shaved and made
himself as elegant-looking as possible for the social engagements of
the evening. He did not like to be alone with Gertrude, so he
never came until after six o&#8217;clock, when he knew that Eleanore
would be at home. Realising that Eleanore was diligently pursuing
the study of French and English, and that her evenings
were therefore of great value to her, he begged her not to be
disturbed by his visits. He said that he found nothing so agreeable
as sitting still and saying nothing. After an hour or two,
however, he left, murmuring an indistinct farewell as he did so.</p>

<p>At times he would bring a book with him and read. If he
chanced to look up, he saw Eleanore bending over the writing
table, her hair, bathed in a flood of golden light from the lamp,
falling in fine silken threads over her temples, while her mouth
was firmly closed, her lips inclined to droop at the corners, but in
a lovely fashion. Then he saw Gertrude. She did not wear her
hair loose; she put it up in a tight knot above her neck. Her
dress was no longer the Nile green; it was made of brown cloth,
and on the front was a row of glistening black buttons.</p>

<p>At times Eleanore would make some remark to him, and he
would reply. At times the remarks between the two spun out into
a verbal skirmish. Eleanore teased, and he was gruff; or he
mocked, and Eleanore delivered a curtain lecture. Gertrude would
sit with an expression of helpless amazement on her face, and look
at the window. She purposely remained unoccupied; she purposely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>postponed her household duties. The thought of leaving
the two alone in the room was unbearable.</p>

<p>What Daniel did and said, how he walked or sat or stood, how
he put his hands in his pockets and smacked his lips, all this and
more aroused a sense of fear and shame in her. She regarded his
candour as impudent presumption; she looked upon his capriciousness
as malevolent irrationality; his indifferent manners and his
disposition to slander she felt certain were of a piece with the
scorn of the devil.</p>

<p>On one occasion he dropped a caustic remark about the bigots
who contend that God is a moralising censor. Having this phase
of ethics under discussion, he also paid his respects to those people
who look upon every worm-eaten pastor as an archangel. Gertrude
got up with a jerk, and stared at him. He stood his ground; he
merely shrugged his shoulders. Gertrude whispered: &#8220;Men without
faith are worse than contagious diseases.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel laughed. Then he became serious, and asked her what
she understood by faith. He wanted to know whether she felt
that faith was a matter of lip service. She replied, with bowed
head, that she could not discuss sacred matters with a man who
had renounced all religion. Daniel told her that her remark was
slanderous. He wanted to know whether she had ever taken the
pains to find out precisely how he stood in matters of religion,
and if not, was this the reason she passed such final judgment on
him with such suddenness and conviction. He asked her point
blank whether she was quite certain that her so-called faith was
better than his so-called unfaith. Not content with this, he asked
where she got her authority, her courage, her feeling of security;
whether she felt she had evidence to prove that she had carefully
examined his soul; and whether she had at any time interviewed
God.</p>

<p>He laughed again, whistled, and left.</p>

<p>Gertrude remained motionless for a while, her eyes fixed on the
floor. Eleanore supported her chin on her hand, and looked at
her compassionately. Gertrude began to tremble in her whole
body, and, without raising her head, she stretched out her arms to
Eleanore. Though quite unable to interpret this accusing gesture,
Eleanore was terrified.</p>

<p>The next time Daniel came, he resumed his seat by the stove,
and remained silent for a while. Then, without the slightest
warning or apparent motivation, he began to discuss religion. And
how? With the old spirit of defiance, as if from an ambuscade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>from which he could send out his poisoned arrows, with calculating
maliciousness and cold rebellion, with the air of a man who has
been defeated, who is now being pursued, and who is willing to
concede more to the earthly order of things than to the divine.
Thus he sat, the incarnation of blasphemy, and once more shuffled
the features of his face until he looked like the sedulous ape.</p>

<p>Eleanore felt that he was denying both himself and God, and
that with violence. She went over to him, and laid her hand on
his shoulder. Gertrude, a death-like pallor playing over her face,
got up, passed by her and Daniel, and did not appear again that
evening. Nor did she appear the following evening. From that
time on she avoided his presence.</p>

<p>For one remarkable second and no longer, Daniel fixed his eyes
on the shape of Gertrude&#8217;s legs. He became suddenly conscious of
the fact that she was a woman and he was a man. During this
second, one of the rarest of his life, he perceived the outer surface
of her body, but without the enveloping clothes. He thought of
her as a nude figure. It lasted only a second, but he pictured her
to himself as a nude. Everything she had said and done fell from
her like so much clothing.</p>

<p>He had a feeling that his eyes had been opened; that he had
really seen for the first time in his life; and that what he now
saw was the body of the world.</p>

<p>The nude picture followed him. He fought against his disquietude.
Nothing like this had ever happened to him before.
He conjured up the picture in order to destroy it with coolness
and composure; but it would not be destroyed, nor would it vanish.
One day he chanced to meet Gertrude by the beautiful fountain.
He stopped, stood as if petrified, and forgot to speak to her.</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>It was a cold, clear day in the middle of December. Eleanore
wanted to go skating after dinner. She was known in the entire
city for her skill on the ice. An irrepressible vivacity and sense
of freedom pulsed through her body. It seemed to her lamentable
that she should have to sit down in the overheated, sticky air of
the office among all those clerks, and write.</p>

<p>She went, nevertheless, to the office, took her place among the
clerks, and wrote as usual. Herr Zittel&#8217;s eyes shone through the
lenses of his spectacles like two poison flasks. But she did not
make much progress; time dragged; it dragged even more heavily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>and slowly than Herr Diruf&#8217;s feet, as he made his rounds through
the room. Eleanore looked up. She felt as if his gloomy eyes
were resting on her. Conscious of having failed to perform her
duty as she might have done, she blushed.</p>

<p>Finally the clock struck six. The other clerks left, making much
noise as they did so. Eleanore waited as usual until they had all
gone, for she did not like to mix with them. Just then Benjamin
Dorn came wabbling in: &#8220;The Chief would like to speak to Fr&auml;ulein
Jordan,&#8221; he said, and bent his long neck like a swan. Eleanore
was surprised: what on earth could Herr Diruf want with her?
Possibly it had to do with Benno.</p>

<p>Alfons Diruf was sitting at his desk as she entered. He wrote
one more line, and then stared at her. There was something in
his expression that drove the blood from her cheeks. Involuntarily
she looked down at herself and felt her flesh creep.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wanted to see me,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I wanted to see you,&#8221; he replied, and made a weary attempt
to smile.</p>

<p>There was another pause. In her anxiety Eleanore looked first
at one object in the room and then at another; first at the bathing
nymph, then at the silk curtains, then at the Chinese lampshade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sweetheart,&#8221; said Herr Diruf, his smile gradually changing
into a sort of convulsion, &#8220;we are not bad, are we? By the
beard of the prophet, we are all right, aren&#8217;t we? Hunh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore lowered her head. She thought she had misunderstood
him: &#8220;You wanted to see me,&#8221; she said in a loud voice.</p>

<p>Diruf laid his hand, palm down, on the edge of his desk.
His solitaire threw off actual sparks of brilliancy. &#8220;I can crush
every one of you,&#8221; he said, as he shoved his hand along the edge
of the desk toward Eleanore. &#8220;That boy out there, your brother,
is an underhanded sharper. If I want to I can make him turn a
somersault, believe me.&#8221; He shoved his fat hand a little farther
along, as if it were some dangerous engine and his solitaire a
signal lamp. &#8220;I can make the whole pack of you dance whenever
I want to. Can&#8217;t I, sweetheart? <i>Capito?</i> <i>Comprenez-vous?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore looked into Alfons Diruf&#8217;s smeary eyes with unspeakable
amazement.</p>

<p>Diruf got up, walked over to her, and put his arms around her
shoulders. &#8220;Well, if the boy is a sweet-toothed tom-cat who can
easily be led astray, you are a purring pussy-cat,&#8221; he said with a
tone of terrible tenderness, and held the girl so tight in his arms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>that she could not possibly move. &#8220;Now be quiet, sweetheart;
be calm, my little bosom; don&#8217;t worry, you little devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>Horror, hot and cold, came over her, and filled her with unnamable
dismay. Contact with the man had a more gruesome
effect on her than anything she had ever even dreamed of. One
jerk as though it were a matter of life and death, and she was
free. White as a sheet, she nevertheless stood there before him,
and smiled. It was a rare smile, something quite beyond the
bounds of what is ordinarily called a smile. Alfons Diruf was no
longer fat and fierce; he was like a pricked bubble; he was done
for. And finding himself alone, he stood there for a while and
gaped at the floor. He looked and felt hopelessly stupid.</p>

<p>Eleanore hastened through the streets, and suddenly discovered
that she was in the Long Row. She turned around. Benda, then
on the way over to call on Daniel, caught sight of her, recognised
her by the light of the gas lamp, stopped as she passed by him,
and looked after her not a little concerned.</p>

<p>When she reached home, she sank down on the sofa exhausted.
To rid her mind of the memory of the past hour, she took refuge
in her longing, longing for a southern country. Her longing was
so intense, her desire to go south so fervent, that her face shone
as if in fever. But the glass case had at last been broken.</p>

<p>The bell rang shortly before eight; she said to Gertrude: &#8220;If it
is Daniel, send him away. I cannot see any one this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ill?&#8221; asked Gertrude with characteristic sternness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; I simply do not want to see anybody,&#8221; said
Eleanore, and smiled again as she had smiled in Diruf&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>It was Daniel, to be sure. Benda had told him that he had seen
Eleanore out in front of the house; and when he learned that she
had not been to call on Daniel, his anxiety increased. &#8220;There is
something wrong here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you had better go see her.&#8221;
After they had talked the situation over for a while Benda accompanied
Daniel as far as &AElig;gydius Place, in order to make sure that
he inquired after Eleanore.</p>

<p>Gertrude opened the iron door. &#8220;Eleanore does not want you
to come in,&#8221; she said, with a trace of joy in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? What has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She does not wish to see you,&#8221; said the monosyllabic Gertrude,
and gazed into the light of the hall lamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;Then she has got to tell me herself that she does not wish to
see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221; commanded Gertrude and tossed her head back.</p>

<p>Her gloomy eyes hung on his, and the two stood there for a
moment opposite each other, like two racers who have come in at the
same goal at the same time but from opposite directions. Daniel
then turned around, and went down the steps in silence. Gertrude
remained standing for a time, her head sinking deeper and deeper
all the while on her breast. Suddenly she covered her face with
her hands; a cold shudder ran through her body.</p>


<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>Before going to bed, Eleanore wrote a letter to Herr Zittel
informing him that she was leaving the Prudentia at once.</p>

<p>Lying in bed, she could not sleep. She saw herself on the ice
cutting bold and novel figures. The spectators, grouped about her
in a wide circle, admired her skill. She saw the sea with fishing
smacks and coloured sails. She saw gardens full of roses.</p>

<p>Her father and Benno had come home long ago. She heard
the bell up in the nearby church tower strike twelve&mdash;and then
one&mdash;and then two.</p>

<p>She heard some one walking back and forth in the house; she
heard some one opening and closing a door. Then the steps died
away, and all was quiet. She got up, went to the door, and
listened. A deep sigh reached her ear from the next room. She
opened the door just a little, without making the slightest noise,
and peeped out through the crack.</p>

<p>Gertrude was standing by the open window; she was in her
night-gown and bare feet. The moon was shining on the square
in front of the house; the glitter of the snow on the roofs made
it seem quite cold. The spooky illumination made the girl&#8217;s face
look spooky. Her loose flowing hair looked as black as ebony.</p>

<p>Eleanore ran into the room, and closed the window. &#8220;What on
earth are you doing, Gertrude?&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;are you getting
ready to take your life?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude&#8217;s slender body shivered in the cold; her toes were all
bent in as if she were having a convulsion. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said with
marked moroseness, &#8220;that is what I would like to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you would like to do?&#8221; replied Eleanore, also
trembling with cold. &#8220;And your father? Haven&#8217;t you the slightest
consideration for him? Do you want to give him more worry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>than he already has? What is the matter with you, you crazy
girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a sinner, Eleanore,&#8221; cried Gertrude, fell on her knees,
and clasped Eleanore about the hips. &#8220;I am a sinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes? A sinner? What sin, pray, have you committed?&#8221;
asked Eleanore, and bent down over her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why am I in that house there, in that prison?&#8221; cried Gertrude,
and clasped her hands to her breast. &#8220;Evil has come over me,
evil has taken possession of me. I have evil thoughts. Look at
me, Eleanore, look at me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice had now mounted to the pitch of a piercing shriek.
Eleanore stepped back from her, terror-stricken. Gertrude fell
head first on the floor. Her hair covered her bent and twitching
back.</p>

<p>The door leading to Jordan&#8217;s room opened, and he himself
came in carrying a lighted candle. In default of pajamas, he had
thrown a chequered shawl around his shoulders, the fringes of
which were dangling about his knees. He had a white-peaked
night-cap on his head.</p>

<p>Quite beside himself, he looked at the two girls and wanted
to say something; but he was speechless. When much worried
he would always smirk. It was a disagreeable habit. In Eleanore
it always aroused a feeling of intense compassion. &#8220;There is nothing
wrong, father,&#8221; she stammered, and made an awkward gesture
which indicated to him that it would be most agreeable to her if
he would go away. &#8220;Gertrude has pains in her stomach; she tried
to go to the medicine chest to get a few drops. Please go, father;
I&#8217;ll put her to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go to the doctor, or I will call Benno and have him
go,&#8221; said Jordan.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, father, it is not necessary. Please go away!&#8221;</p>

<p>He appreciated Eleanore&#8217;s impatience and obediently withdrew,
shielding the light of the candle with his hand; his gigantic
shadow followed along behind him like some unclassified animal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up, Gertrude, get up and come with me!&#8221; said Eleanore.</p>

<p>Gertrude was taken back to her room. After she had been in
bed for a few minutes, there was a knock at the door. It was
Jordan; he asked how she felt. Eleanore told him everything
was all right.</p>

<p>Until the moon had disappeared below the church roof, Eleanore
sat on Gertrude&#8217;s bed, and held her mute hand in her own.
Though she had thrown a cloak about her shoulders, she was cold.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>Gertrude lay with open, lifeless eyes. Every movement of
Eleanore&#8217;s face revealed the changing moods of her soul: she was
thinking over an unending series of grave thoughts. When it
became quite dark, Gertrude turned her face to Eleanore, and said
softly: &#8220;Please get in bed with me, Eleanore. If I see you sleeping,
possibly I can sleep too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore laid the cloak to one side, and slipped in under the
covers. The two girls cuddled up to each other, and in a few
minutes both were sound asleep.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Daniel</span> gradually gained followers. Those whom the &#8220;little
slave&#8221; won over to his cause were hardly to be called patrons:
they were patriots. They were delighted at the thought that a
<i>maestro</i> should have been born and risen to fame in soulful old
Franconia. In the actual life of their prot&eacute;g&eacute; they took but little
interest.</p>

<p>Daniel&#8217;s followers were young people.</p>

<p>Professor Herold was a strange man. His reputation reached far
beyond the boundaries of his native province, and yet, owing to
his whimsical peculiarities, he had not the slightest desire to leave
home. On such sons and daughters of the natives as were diligent
in their pursuit of musical studies, he poured out the whole of his
sarcasm. His chief, his darling ambition was to wean them away
from their fondness for worthless music and clap-trap performances
of it. He did not succeed: you were not considered educated
unless you could play the piano, and in the homes of these merchants
education was highly regarded.</p>

<p>Enticed by his name, all kinds of people came from a distance to
take lessons from Professor Herold. Having read the score of
&#8220;Vineta,&#8221; he said to two of these: &#8220;Fetch me that fellow dead or
alive.&#8221; And they fetched him.</p>

<p>The two came more frequently to Daniel, and then others,
pupils of Professors Wackerbarth and D&ouml;derlein. At times he
would take luncheon with them in the students&#8217; restaurant. We
will call them the long-haired, or the pale-faced. Many of them
looked like snake-charmers. They were almost without exception
hopelessly stupid, but they all had some kind of a bee in their
bonnet.</p>

<p>There were some young girls among them; we will call them
the dreamy-eyed, or the lost-in-dreams. Daniel had no use for
them whatsoever. His patience with the long-haired was equally
lacking.</p>

<p>He told &#8220;the old man,&#8221; as Professor Herold was called, of his
antipathy to these students. Professor Herold snapped like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>vicious dog, brushed the white bristles back over his enormous head,
and said: &#8220;Well, my young original, you have made a discovery.
Don&#8217;t you know that music cajoles into its magic circle the very
riff-raff of any community? Don&#8217;t you know that music is a
subterfuge for the neglect of human duty? Don&#8217;t you know that
the voluptuous fumes it spreads over the cities results in the general
corrosion and consumption of men&#8217;s hearts? Don&#8217;t you know
that of every five hundred so-called artists, four hundred and
ninety-nine are nothing but the cripple guard of God above?
Therefore he who does not come to music with the holiest fire
burning in the depths of his soul has his blood in time transformed
by it into glue, his mind into a heap of rubbish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereat he pushed Daniel out of the door, so that he might
work undisturbed on his little pictures. Of these the walls of his
room were full. He painted them in his leisure hours. They
were small in size, and smaller still in merit; but he was proud
of them. They represented scenes from country life.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>On New Year&#8217;s Eve, D&ouml;rmaul, the impresario, gave a dinner in
the Little Swan, to which he invited Daniel. D&ouml;rmaul was quite
well disposed toward Daniel. He said he had recognised the young
man&#8217;s talents at the sight of his very first note. He promised to
publish &#8220;Vineta&#8221; and also the work Daniel had finished in the
meantime, entitled &#8220;Nuremberg Serenade.&#8221; He also seemed inclined
to consider favourably Daniel&#8217;s appointment in his newly
founded opera company.</p>

<p>Among those present at the dinner were Professors Herold and
Wackerbarth, Wurzelmann, a few of the long-haired and a few
of the lost-in-dreams. Andreas D&ouml;derlein had promised to come
in later. He appeared, as a matter of fact, five minutes before
midnight, and stood in the wide-opened door as ceremonious as
the New Year itself.</p>

<p>He went up to Daniel, and extended him his right hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look who&#8217;s here! Our Benjamin and our John, not to mention
our Daniel,&#8221; he said, glancing at the last of the trio. &#8220;Congratulations,
my young star! What do the annals from Andreas
D&ouml;derlein&#8217;s nose for news have to report? Back in Bayreuth,
when we used to draw our wine by the flask, he merely had to
sniffle around a bit to know just how things were. Isn&#8217;t that true,
Benjamin?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p><p>Nobody denied it. Benjamin let right yield to mercy. The
mighty man removed his storm-cape from his shoulders as though
it were ermine he were doffing before condescending to associate
with ordinary mortals.</p>

<p>Professor Wackerbarth had a wife who beat him and gave him
nothing to eat: he regarded this as a rare opportunity to eat his
fill and have a good time generally. But it was a poor sort of a
good time.</p>

<p>One of the long-haired sang the champagne song, and Wurzelmann
made a witty speech. D&ouml;derlein suggested that now was the
time to let the mice dance and the fleas hop. When one of the
lost-in-dreams sang David&#8217;s March, which according to the rules
of Bayreuth could not be classed as real music, D&ouml;derlein exclaimed:
&#8220;Give me Lethe, my fair one.&#8221; By &#8220;Lethe&#8221; he meant punch.</p>

<p>Daniel drank Lethe too. He embraced old Herold, shook hands
with Andreas D&ouml;derlein, and tried to waltz with Wurzelmann.
He was not drunk; he was merely happy.</p>

<p>Then it became too close for him in the room. He took his
hat, put on his overcoat, and hurried out.</p>

<p>The air was warm, mild. A south wind was blowing. Heaven
above, heaven below, the houses were standing on clouds. One
breath made him thirsty for the next one. There was a bay-window;
it was so beautiful that he felt like kneeling before it.
There was a fountain; it was so snug and exotic that it seemed
like a poem. There were the arches of the bridge; in them was
the dim reflection of the water. There were two towers; they
were as delicate as a spider&#8217;s web.</p>

<p>He rejoiced and exclaimed: &#8220;Oh world, art thou real? Art
thou my world, and am I living in thee? My world, my year,
my time, and I in it all, I myself!&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>He stood on &AElig;gydius Place, and looked up at the windows in
Jordan&#8217;s house. They were all dark.</p>

<p>He wanted to call out, but the name that was on his lips filled
him with anxiety. The passionate flutter of his heart almost tore
his breast asunder.</p>

<p>He had to do something; he had to speak; he had to ask questions
and hear a human voice. Consequently, he hurried out to
the F&uuml;ll, stood under Benda&#8217;s window, and called Benda&#8217;s name.
The clocks struck three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p><p>The blinds were soon drawn to one side, and Benda&#8217;s stoutish
figure appeared at the open window. &#8220;Daniel? Is it you?
What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. I merely wanted to bring you New Year&#8217;s greetings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you are bringing me something good? Go home
and go to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, let me come in a little while, Friedrich. Let&#8217;s chat for a
moment or two about happiness!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be reasonable! We might frighten happiness away by our
talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Philistine! Well, give me your blessing at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have it. Now go, night owl, and let the people sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another window opened on the ground floor. Herr Carovius&#8217;s
desolate nocturnal physiognomy appeared at the window, looked up,
looked down on the disturber of the peace on the street, and with
one mighty grim, grinning sound on his lips, his revengeful fist
swinging in the meanwhile, the indignant man closed the window
with a bang.</p>

<p>Something impelled Daniel to return to &AElig;gydius Place. Again
he looked up at the windows, this time beseechingly. The storm
within his heart became more violent. For a long time he ran
through the streets, and reached home at last along toward five
o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>As he passed through the dark hall, he saw a light up on the
landing. Meta was carrying it. She was already stirring about,
ready to begin her morning&#8217;s work. He hesitated; he looked at
her; with three steps he was by her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;So late?&#8221; she whispered with premonitory embarrassment, and
began to finger her dress, which she had not yet buttoned up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what a joy to take hold of a living human being on this
glorious day!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She offered some resistance, but when he tried to take her into
her room, she bent her body backward, and thus pressed about
his wrist. She was still carrying the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you only knew how I feel, Meta. I need you. Hold
me tight in your arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no more resistance. Perhaps she too was not without
her fervent desire. Perhaps it was the time of day that made
nature more insistent than usual. Perhaps she was suffering from
loneliness in the company of the three sisters. It was still night
and dark; but for her it was already day; it was the first day in
the year, and she greeted it in festive mood. She yielded to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p><p>She was a virgin; she had no idea of the responsibility she was
taking upon herself. Man had never been exactly a mystery to
her, but now she felt for the first time the congenerous creature&mdash;and
she gave in to him.</p>

<p>Daniel returned to earth after having knocked at the portals
of the gods with tremendous wishes. The gods smiled their profoundest
smile; for they had decided to have an especial fate
arise from this hour.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>A meeting of the Social Democrats was being held in Gosten
Court. They had met to discuss the Chancellor&#8217;s speech on accident
insurance.</p>

<p>The first speaker was Deputy St&ouml;rbecker. But his voice had no
carrying power, and what he said died away almost unheard.</p>

<p>Jason Philip Schimmelweis followed him. He presented a
fearful indictment of the government. The official representative
of the government advised him to be more reserved, whereupon he
reinvigorated himself with a draught of beer. Then he hurled the
full beaker of that wrathful scorn for which his heart, beating for
the people, was noted, at the head of the individual who was first
and foremost responsible for the affairs of the Empire. He did
not mention Bismarck by name; he spoke instead of a certain bogey.
He snatched the halo from his head, swore that he would some
day unmask him and show the people that he was a traitor, branded
his fame as a tissue of lies, his deeds as the disgrace of the century.</p>

<p>The venomous and eloquent hatred of the pudgy little man
inflamed the minds that drank in his oratory. Jason Philip was
greeted with a tumult of applause as he took his seat. His face
was a bright scarlet red.</p>

<p>The leaders of the party, however, were noticeably quiet. In a
moment or two, Deputy St&ouml;rbecker returned with two comrades
eager to enter into a debate with Jason Philip. He followed them
into a side room. Exalted at the thought that they had been delegated
to express to him the gratitude of the party for his speech,
he smiled the smile of vanity and caressed his beard with his
fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter, gentlemen? Why are you so serious?
Did I go too far? I assume complete responsibility for everything
I said. But be calm! They are getting afraid of us. The air
has a dubious odour. The French are becoming cantankerous again.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;No, Comrade Schimmelweis, that is not it. You have got to
vindicate yourself. You are a Proteus, Comrade Schimmelweis.
Your right hand does not know what your left hand is doing.
You are treating us disgracefully. You are ploughing in the
widow&#8217;s garden. You preach water and guzzle wine. You have
entered into a conspiracy with the grafters of the town. You are
in collusion with the people down at the Prudentia, and you are
filling your own coffers in this gigantic swindle. From morning
to night you enrich yourself with the hard-earned pennies of the
poor. That is sharp practice, Jason Philip Schimmelweis, sharp
practice, we say. Now you have got to sever all connection with
the Prudentia, or the Party is going to kick you out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then it was that Jason Philip Schimmelweis rose to his true
heights of eloquence. He insisted that his hands were clean, his
left one and also his right one; that he was working in the interest
of a good cause; and that threats could not intimidate him. He
made it plain that he would bow to no dictatorship operating under
the mask of equality and fraternity. He cried out that if the
people wanted a scandal they could have it, but they would find
him armed to the teeth. And he assured them that wherever he
went in this wide, wide world, he would find the doors open to
welcome him.</p>

<p>He then made a sudden about-face, and left his comrades standing.
On the way home he continued to murmur murmurs of
embitterment to himself.</p>

<p>Like a seasoned sailor eager to escape the storms of a raging sea,
he steered his good ship toward other and more hospitable shores.
Three days later he went to Baron Siegmund von Auffenberg, the
leader of the Liberals, and offered him his services. He told him
that he was willing to make any sacrifice for the great Liberal
Party.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>For thirty-five minutes, by his own watch, he cooled his heels
in the ante-chamber. He made one caustic remark after another
touching on the arrested development of the feeling of equality
among the rich. Genuine rebel that he was, he did not repudiate
himself even when he was practising high treason.</p>

<p>When he was finally taken into the office, he was not blinded
in the slightest by the luxuriousness of the furniture, the rugs, or
the oil paintings. He displayed not the remotest shimmer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>servility on meeting the illustrious Baron. He sat down on one
of the chairs with complete equanimity, took no notice of the
French-speaking parrot, and never cast a single glance at the breakfast
table covered with appetising tid-bits. But he did present
his case with all due straightforwardness and simplicity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said the Baron, &#8220;fine! I hardly believe that you will
find it necessary to make a radical change in your battlefront. A
conscienceless agitator you have never been. You have a family, a
home of your own; your affairs are in good condition; and in
the bottom of your heart you love order and discipline. I have
in truth been expecting you for a long while. Nor am I exaggerating
when I confess to you that you had to bolt, sooner or
later.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jason Philip blushed with satisfaction. With the bearing of a
cabman who has just pocketed his tip, he replied: &#8220;I thank you
very much, Baron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On one point we are wholly agreed,&#8221; said the Baron, &#8220;and it
seems to me to be the most important&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; interrupted Jason Philip, &#8220;you allude to the
fight against Bismarck. Yes, on this point we are, I hope, of
precisely the same opinion. I will do my part. Hand and heart
on it, Baron. I could look with perfectly cold blood on this
knight of obscurantism writhing on the rack.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herr von Auffenberg heard this temperamental statement with
noticeably tenuous reassurance. He smiled just a little, and then
said: &#8220;Wait a minute, my friend, don&#8217;t be quite so savage.&#8221; He
reached for his smelling salts, held them to his nose, and closed
his eyes. Then he got up, folded his hands across his back, and
walked up and down the room a few times.</p>

<p>What he said after this was as familiar to him as the letters of
the alphabet. While Jason Philip gaped at his lips in dumb
inspiration, the Baron himself thought of things that had not the
remotest connection with what he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very same man who tried to make the new Empire inhabitable,
with the aid of a liberal code of laws, and who brought
the long-drawn-out quarrel between the Emperor and the Pope
to a happy conclusion, is now trying, by word, thought, and deed,
gradually to destroy all liberal traditions and to proclaim the Roman
High Priest as the real creator of peace. All that the German
Chancellor could do to give the final blow to liberalism he has
done. The reaction has not hesitated to abandon the idea of the
<i>Kulturkampf</i> and to work instead in the interests of class hatred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>and racial prejudice, nurturing them even with deeds of violence.
Faced with the crimes they themselves have committed, they will
see their own children despised and rejected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>D&eacute;p&ecirc;che-toi, mon bon gar&ccedil;on</i>,&#8221; screeched the parrot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am happy at the thought of having snatched a precious booty
from the claws of anarchy, and of having won a new citizen for
the State, my dear Herr Schimmelweis. But for the time being
it will be advisable for you to keep somewhat in the background.
They will be inclined to make your change of political conviction
the subject of vociferous attacks, and that might injure the cause.&#8221;</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>What was the old Baron really thinking about while he delivered
this political speech?</p>

<p>There was just one thought in his mind; the same sullen, concealed
anger gnawed incessantly at his heart.</p>

<p>He thought incessantly of his son, of the contempt which he
had experienced because of him, and was still experiencing daily,
even hourly, because of the fact that Eberhard had withdrawn from
his power, had repudiated him.</p>

<p>He could not get over the fact that he had heaped up millions,
and that Eberhard, so far as it was humanly possible to calculate&mdash;and
in accordance with the law&mdash;would some day fall heir to a
part of these millions. He knew very little about poverty; but
his poisoned mind could think of nothing else than the satisfaction
he would derive from being able, somehow, to deliver this
abortive scion of his own name and blood over to poverty. Thus
did he wish to take vengeance; thus would he punish.</p>

<p>But it was impossible for him to wreak vengeance on his son as
he would have liked to: between the execution of the punishment
and himself stood the law. The very thought that his riches were
increasing daily, hourly, that the millions he had were creating new
millions without his moving a finger, that he could not even stop
the flood if he wished to, and that consequently the share of this
disloyal, rebellious, and hateful son was becoming larger daily, even
hourly&mdash;this thought he could not endure. It poisoned his peace
of mind, paralysed his powers, robbed him of all natural and
legitimate joy, and enveloped his days in a cloud of despair.</p>

<p>A modern Midas, he transformed everything he touched into
gold; and the more gold he had the sadder his life became, the
more revengeful his soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p><p>The tones of a piano reached his ear; it was his wife who was
playing. She played Mendelssohn&#8217;s &#8220;Song Without Words.&#8221; He
shook with disgust; for of all things repulsive, music was to him
the most repulsive.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>D&eacute;p&ecirc;che-toi, mon bon gar&ccedil;on</i>,&#8221; screeched the parrot.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>During Jason Philip&#8217;s absence, poorly dressed people frequently
came to the shop and demanded that Theresa give them back the
money they had paid in on their insurance.</p>

<p>Some of them became very much excited when Theresa told
them that she would do nothing of the kind, that the insurance
was the affair of her husband, and that she had nothing whatever
to do with it. A locksmith&#8217;s apprentice had given a sound thrashing
to Zwanziger, the clerk, who had hastened up to protect the wife
of his employer. A gold-beater from F&uuml;rth had created so much
excitement that the police had to be called in. A cooper&#8217;s widow,
who had managed to pay her premiums for one year, but had been
unable to continue the payment for the quite sufficient reason that
she had been in the hospital, fell headlong to the floor in epileptic
convulsions when she heard how matters stood.</p>

<p>It finally reached the point where Theresa was frightened every
time she saw a strange face. She breathed more easily when a
day had passed without some disagreeable scene, but trembled at
the thought of what might happen on the day to come.</p>

<p>What disturbed her more than anything else was the inexplicable
disappearance of small sums of money; this had been going on
for some time. A man came into the office once and laid his
monthly premium, one taler in all, on the counter. When he
left, Theresa closed the door behind him in order that she might
be able to watch the snow storm from the window. When she
returned to the desk the taler had disappeared. She asked where
it was. Jason Philip, who was just then handing some books up
the ladder to Zwanziger, became so gruff that one might have
thought she had accused him of the theft. She counted the money
over in the till, but in vain; the taler had vanished.</p>

<p>She had forgotten, or had not noticed, that Philippina had been
in the office. She had brought her father his evening sandwiches,
and then gone out again without making the slightest noise; she
wore felt shoes.</p>

<p>On another occasion she missed a number of groschen from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>purse. On still another, a spice merchant came in and demanded
that she pay a bill of three marks. She was certain she had already
paid it; she was certain she had given Philippina the money to pay
it. Philippina was called in. She, however, denied having anything
to do with it, and acted with such self-assurance that Theresa,
completely puzzled, reached down in her pocket and handed over
the three marks in perfect silence.</p>

<p>She had suspected the maid, she had suspected the clerk. She
even suspected Jason Philip himself; she thought that he was
appropriating money to pay his drinking expenses. And she suspected
Philippina. But in no case could she produce the evidence;
her spying and investigating were in vain. Then the thieving
stopped again.</p>

<p>For Philippina, who had been doing all the stealing, feared
she might be discovered, and adopted a less hazardous method of
making herself a rich woman: she stole books, and sold them to the
second-hand dealer. She was sly enough to take books that had
been on the shelves for a long while, and not to do all her business
with one dealer: she would go first to one and then to another.</p>

<p>The money which she scraped together in this way, as secretly
and greedily as a jack-daw, she hid in the attic. There was a
loose brick in the wall near the chimney. This she removed; and
in time she removed other bricks. And once her treasures were
safely stored in the hole, she would replace the bricks and set a
board up against them.</p>

<p>When everything had become perfectly quiet and she felt wholly
at ease, she would sit down, fold her hands, and give herself up
to speechless meditation, an evil and fanatic dream playing over
her features as she did.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>One evening in February, Theresa and Philippina chanced to be
sitting by the lamp mending the week&#8217;s wash. Jason Philip entered
the room; there was a sheepish expression on his face; he rubbed
his hands.</p>

<p>Since Theresa did not consider it worth her trouble to ask him
why he was in such a good humour, he suddenly laughed out loud
and said: &#8220;Now we can pack up, my dear. I see it in writing:
The wonder of the age, or the humiliated relatives. A touching
tableau presented by Herr Daniel Nothafft of the Schimmelweis
family.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;I do not understand you; you are talking like a harlequin
again,&#8221; said Theresa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Compositions by Daniel are going to be played in a public concert,&#8221;
Philippina informed her mother with that old, harsh voice
of hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; asked Theresa, in a tone of evident distrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;I read it in the paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The miracle is to take place in the Harmony Society,&#8221; said
Jason Philip, by way of confirming Philippina&#8217;s remark, with an
expression of enigmatic malevolence. &#8220;There is to be a public
rehearsal on Thursday, and there is nothing on earth that can keep
me away. The music dealer, Zierfuss, has given me two tickets,
and if you want to, why, you can come along and see how they
make a local hero out of a plain loafer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; responded Theresa, in a tone of contemptuous amazement,
&#8220;not one step will I take. What have I got to do with your imbecile
concerts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But these gentlemen are going to be disillusioned, terribly
so,&#8221; continued Jason Philip in a threatening tone. &#8220;There is
still a certain amount of common sense left, just as there are means
of proceeding against a common, ordinary swindler.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina raised her head in the mood of a person who has
come to a sudden decision: &#8220;C&#8217;n I go &#8217;long, Pop?&#8221; she asked, her
ears as red as fire.</p>

<p>It was more than a request. Jason Philip was startled at the
intractable expression on the girl&#8217;s face. &#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said, avoiding
as well as he could the mute opposition on the part of Theresa,
&#8220;but take a whistle along so that you can make cat calls.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sank back with a comfortable sigh on his chair, and stretched
out his legs. Philippina knelt down and took off his boots. He
then put on his slippers. Each of them bore a motto embroidered
in red. On the left one were the words &#8220;For tired father&#8221;; on
the right one, &#8220;Consolation.&#8221;</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Eleanore had not told her father why she had left her position
with Alfons Diruf. Nor did Jordan ask her why when he learned
that she did not wish to speak about it. He suspected that there
was some disagreeable incident back of it, and if he maintained a
strict silence it was because he feared his own wrath and grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p><p>She soon found another position. A schoolmate and good friend
of hers, Martha Degen, the daughter of the pastry-baker, had
married Herr R&uuml;bsam, a notary public and an old man to boot.
Eleanore visited the R&uuml;bsams occasionally, as did also her father;
and in the course of conversation it came out that Herr R&uuml;bsam
needed an assistant copyist. Since it was then impossible to
give Eleanore a desk in the office, she was allowed to do all her
work at home.</p>

<p>Friedrich Benda had also given her a cordial letter of recommendation
to Herr Bock, Counsellor of Archives, who was just then
engaged in writing a voluminous work on the history of Nuremberg.
It would be her task to arrange Herr Bock&#8217;s muddled
manuscript.</p>

<p>It was a laborious undertaking, but she learned a great deal
from it. Her thirsty mind would draw nourishment even from
dry and lifeless subjects.</p>

<p>She was seized with a desire to fill up the gaps in her education.
She begged Benda first for this book and then for that one. And
after having written the whole day long, she would often sit
down and read until late at night.</p>

<p>Everything she came in contact with she either assimilated or
shook off: she dragged nothing along in the form of surface impedimenta;
it became a part of her being, or she threw it to one
side.</p>

<p>Daniel had not called for a long while. He was busy with
the rehearsals which Wurzelmann was conducting. Professor
D&ouml;derlein was not to take charge of the orchestra until it had been
thoroughly drilled. The programme was to consist of Daniel&#8217;s
works and the &#8220;Leonore Overture.&#8221; Wurzelmann referred to the
Beethoven number as &#8220;a good third horse in the team.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel also had a lot of business to transact with the impresario
D&ouml;rmaul: the company was to go on the road in March, and many
things had to be attended to. The contract he signed was for
three years at a salary of six hundred marks a year.</p>

<p>A few days before the public rehearsal he came to Jordan&#8217;s with
three tickets: one for Jordan himself and the other two for the
sisters. The public rehearsal was quite like a regular concert; over
a hundred persons had been invited.</p>

<p>Jordan was just getting ready to go out. &#8220;That is fine, that
is great: I can hear some more music now. I am looking forward
to the concert with extreme pleasure. When I was a young
fellow I rarely missed a concert. But that was long ago; indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>when I think it over I see how old I am. The years pass by like
milestones on the highway of life. Well, Daniel, I thank you,
thank you very much!&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore&#8217;s joy was also great. As soon as her father had gone,
she remarked that Daniel had looked for Gertrude; but she had
left the room as soon as she saw him coming. Eleanore opened
the door, and cried: &#8220;Gertrude, come in, right away! I have a
surprise for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a while Gertrude came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;A ticket for you to Daniel&#8217;s concert,&#8221; said Eleanore, radiant
with joy, and handed her the green card of admission.</p>

<p>Gertrude looked at Eleanore; and she wanted to look at Daniel.
But her heavy glance, slowly rising from the floor, barely reached
his face before it returned to its downward position, aggrieved
and pained. Then she shook her head, and said: &#8220;A ticket for the
concert? For me? Are you serious, Eleanore?&#8221; Again she shook
her head, amazed and indignant. Whereupon she went to the
window, leaned her arm against the cross bars, and pressed her
head against her arm.</p>

<p>Daniel followed her with looks of glowing anger. &#8220;You can
take sheep to the slaughter,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you can throw thieves in a
dungeon, you can transport lepers to a hospital for incurables,
but you cannot force an emotional girl to listen to music.&#8221;</p>

<p>He became silent; a pause ensued. Tortured at the thought
that Daniel&#8217;s eyes were riveted on her back, Gertrude turned
around, went to the stove, sat down, and pressed her cheek against
the Dutch tiles.</p>

<p>Daniel took two steps, stood by her side, and exclaimed: &#8220;But
suppose I request that you go? Suppose my peace of mind or
something else of importance to the world, consolation, liberation,
or improvement, depends on your going? Suppose I request that
you go for one of these reasons? What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude had become as pale as death. She looked at him for
a moment, then turned her face to one side, drew up her shoulders
as if she were shivering with cold, and said: &#8220;Well&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;I&#8217;ll
go. But I will be sorry for it ... sorry for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore was a witness to this scene. Her eyes, wide open
when it began, grew larger and larger as it advanced through its
successive stages. As she looked at Daniel a kindly, languishing
moisture came to them, and she smiled.</p>

<p>Daniel, however, had become vexed. He mumbled a good-bye
and left. Eleanore went to the window and watched him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>as he ran across the square, holding his hat with both hands as a
shield against the driving wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is an amusing fellow,&#8221; she said, &#8220;an amusing fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She then lifted her eyes to the clouds, whose swift flight above
the church roof pleased her.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>It was the original intention to begin the regular evening concert
with the third &#8220;Fidelio Overture.&#8221; D&ouml;derlein was of the
opinion that it offered no special difficulties: the general rehearsal
was to be devoted primarily to the works of the novice. He
raised his baton, and silence filled the auditorium.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Nuremberg Serenade&#8221; opened with ensemble playing of
the wind instruments. It was a jovial, virile theme which the
violins took up after the wind instruments, plucked it to pieces
in their capricious way, and gradually led it over into the realm
of dreams. The night became living: a gentle summer wind blew,
glow worms flitted about, Gothic towers stood out in the sultry
darkness, plebeian figures crept into the narrow, angular alleys;
it was night in Nuremberg. The acclamation a glorious past with
an admonition to the future fell upon the smug complacency of
the present, the heroic mingled with the jocose, the fantastic
with the burlesque, romanticism found its counterpart, and all
this was achieved through a flood of genuine melody in which
stodginess played no part, while charm was abundant in every turn
and tune.</p>

<p>The professional musicians were astonished; and their astonishment
was vigorously expressed in their criticisms. The general
admiration, to be sure, was somewhat deafened by the unpleasant
end that the rehearsal was destined to come to; but one critic,
who enjoyed complete independence of soul, though an unfortunate
incident in his life had compelled him to relinquish his influential
circle in the city and retire to a limited sphere of activity in the
province, wrote: &#8220;This artist has the unquestioned ability to become
the light and leader of his generation. Nature created him,
his star developed him. May Heaven give him the power and
patience indispensable to the artist, if he would be born again and
become a man above the gifts of men. If he only does not reach
out too soon for the ripe fruits, and, intoxicated by the allurements
of the lower passions, fail to hear the voice of his heart! He
has taken a lofty flight; the azure gates of renown have swung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>wide open to him. Let him only be cautious about his second
descent into the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same connoisseur found the composition of &#8220;Vineta&#8221; less
ingenious, and its instrumentation suffering from the lean experience
of a beginner. Yet even this work was strongly applauded.
The impresario D&ouml;rmaul clapped his hands until the perspiration
poured from his face. Wurzelmann was beside himself with enthusiasm.
Old Herold smiled all over his face. The long-haired
found it of course quite difficult to subdue their jealousy, but
even they were not stingy with their recognition.</p>

<p>But how did Herr Carovius feel? His spittle had a bitter
taste, his body pained him. When Andreas D&ouml;derlein turned
to the audience and bowed, Carovius laughed a laugh of tremendous
contempt. And Jason Philip Schimmelweis? He would
have felt much more comfortable if the hand-clapping had been
so much ear-boxing, and Daniel Nothafft, the culprit, had been
the objective. The boy who had been cast out had become
the leader of men! Jason Philip put his hand to his forehead,
shook his head, and was on the point of exclaiming, &#8220;Oh, ye deceivers
and deceived! Listen, listen! I know the boy; I know
the man who has made fools of you here this evening!&#8221; He
waited to see whether the misunderstanding, the colossal swindle,
would not be cleared up automatically. He did not wait in vain.</p>

<p>At the close of the &#8220;Serenade,&#8221; Jordan was struck by Gertrude&#8217;s
feverish paleness. He asked her whether she felt ill, but received
no reply. During the performance of the second piece she kept
putting her hands to her bosom, as if she were suffering from
repressed convulsions. Her eyes were now lifeless, now glowing
with an uncanny fire. As soon as the piece was finished, she
turned to her father and asked him to take her home. Jordan
was frightened. Those sitting next to him looked at the girl&#8217;s
pale face, sympathised with her, and made conventional remarks.
Eleanore wanted to go home too, but Gertrude whispered to her
in her imperious way and told her to stay. Familiar as she was
with Gertrude&#8217;s disposition, she thought that it was simply a passing
attack of some kind, and regained her composure.</p>

<p>Daniel was standing at the door, talking to Benda and Wurzelmann.
He was very much excited; his two companions were
trying to appease his embitterment against Andreas D&ouml;derlein.
&#8220;Ah, the man doesn&#8217;t know a thing about his profession,&#8221; he exclaimed,
and scorned all attempts to effect a reconciliation between
him and the leader of the orchestra. &#8220;What is left of my compositions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>is debris only. He drags the time, never even tries to
make a <i>legatura</i>, scorns a <i>piano</i> every time he comes to one, pays no
attention to <i>crescendos</i>, never retards&mdash;it is terrible! My works
cannot be played in public like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude and her father passed by quickly and without greeting.
Daniel was stupefied. The lifeless expression in Gertrude&#8217;s
face unnerved him. He felt as if he had been struck by a hammer,
as if his own fate were inseparably connected with that of
the girl. Her step, her eyes, her mouth were, he felt, a part of
his own being. And the fact that she passed by without even
speaking to him, cold, reserved, hostile, filled him with such intense
anger that from then on he was not accountable for what
he did.</p>

<p>The flood of melody in Beethoven&#8217;s great work was on the
point of pouring forth from the orchestra in all its exalted ruggedness.
What happened? There came forth instead a confused,
noisy clash and clatter. Daniel was seized with violent restlessness.
It was hard enough to see his own works bungled; to see this
creation with its delicate soul and titanic power, a work which he
knew as he knew few things on this earth, torn to tatters and
bungled all around was more than he could stand. The trumpet
solo did not sound as though it came from some distant land of
fairy spirits: it was manifestly at the people&#8217;s feet and it was flat.
He began to tremble. When the calm melancholy andante, completely
robbed of all measure and proportion by the unskilled hand
of the leader and made to dissipate in senseless sounds, reached
his ear, he was beside himself. He rushed on to the platform,
seized the arm of the conductor with his icy fingers, and shouted:
&#8220;That is enough! That is no way to treat a divine creation!&#8221;</p>

<p>The people rose in their seats. The instruments suddenly became
silent, with the exception of a cello which still whimpered from
the corner. Andreas D&ouml;derlein bounded back, looked at the mad
man, his mouth as wide as he could open it, laid the baton on the
desk, and stammered: &#8220;By Jupiter, this is unheard of!&#8221; The
musicians left their places and grouped themselves around the
strange man; the tumult in the public grew worse and worse.
They asked questions, threatened, tried to set each other at ease,
scolded and raged. In the meantime Daniel Nothafft, his head
bowed, his back bent, stood there on the platform, glowing with
anger and determined to have his revenge.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Andreas D&ouml;derlein was sitting at the table
in the musicians&#8217; waiting room. He looked like Emperor Barbarossa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>in Kyffh&auml;user. He had well founded reason to express
his contempt for the decadence and impiety of the youth of to-day.
It was superfluous for him to remark that a man who would
conduct himself as Daniel had done should be eliminated from the
ranks of those who lay claim to the help and consideration of sane
people. The dignified gentlemen of the Orchestral Union were
of the same opinion; you could search the annals of history from
the beginning of time, and you would never find a case like this.
Mild eyes flashed, grey beards wagged. The deliberation was
brief, the sentence just. A committee waited on Daniel to inform
him that his compositions had been struck from the programme.
The news spread like wild-fire.</p>

<p>Who was happier than Jason Philip Schimmelweis?</p>

<p>He was like a man who gets up from the table with a full
stomach, after having sat down at it fearing lest he starve to death.
On his way home he whistled and laughed alternately and with
well balanced proportion.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you see it again,&#8221; he said to his daughter, as she walked
along at his side, &#8220;you see it again: you cannot get blood from a
turnip any more than you can get happiness from misery. A jackass
remains a jackass, a culprit a culprit, and loafing never fails
to bring the loafer to a disgraceful end. The Devil has a short
but nimble tail; and it makes no difference how slovenly he may
conduct his business, his recruits have got to pay the piper in the
end. This will be a windfall for mother. Let&#8217;s hurry so that
we can serve it to her while it&#8217;s still hot!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Philippina&mdash;she had never taken her eyes off the floor the
entire evening&mdash;seemed to be utterly unconscious of the fact at
present that she was surrounded by houses and people. She was a
defeated woman; she wanted to be. She had much to conceal;
her young breast was a hell of emotions, but her ugly, gloomy
old face was as inanimate and empty as a stone.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius waited at the gate. After all the other people
had gone, Daniel, Benda, Wurzelmann, and Eleanore came along.
Daniel&#8217;s storm cape fluttered in the wind; his hat was drawn down
over his eyes. Herr Carovius stepped up before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;A heroic deed, my dear Nothafft,&#8221; he miauled. &#8220;I could embrace
you. From this time on you can count me among your friends.
Now stand still, you human being transformed into a hurricane.
I must say of course that so far as your music is concerned, I am not
with you. There is too much hullaballoo in it, and not enough
plain hellishness to suit me. But rid this country of the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>tribe of D&ouml;derleins, and you will find that I am your man. Not
that I would invite you to take dinner with me, so that you could
have me make you a loan, not on your life. I am only a poor
musician myself. But otherwise I am at your service. I hope
you sleep well to-night&mdash;and get the hullaballoo out of your
music just as soon as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tittered, and then scampered away. Daniel looked at him
with a feeling of astonishment. Wurzelmann laughed, and said he
had never seen such a queer codger in all his life. All four stood
there for a while, not knowing exactly what to think, and in the
meantime it was snowing and raining. Asked by Benda where he
wished to go, Daniel said he was going home. But what could he
do at home? Why couldn&#8217;t he go home with Benda? &#8220;No,&#8221;
said Daniel, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do that: I am a burden to every one to-day,
including myself. Say, little servant, how are you feeling?&#8221; he
said, turning to Wurzelmann, &#8220;how about a drink or two?&#8221;</p>

<p>Wurzelmann, somewhat embarrassed, said that he had an engagement.
There was something repulsive in the way he declined the
invitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you, with your old engagement,&#8221; said Daniel, &#8220;I don&#8217;t give
a hang where you are going; I am going along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re not, Daniel,&#8221; cried Eleanore. And when Daniel
looked at her in astonishment, she blushed and continued: &#8220;You
are not going with him; he is going to see some women!&#8221;</p>

<p>The three young men laughed, and in her confusion Eleanore
laughed too.</p>

<p>&#8220;How tragic you are, little Eleanore,&#8221; said Daniel in a tone of
unusual flippancy, &#8220;what do you want me to do? Do you think
that Wurzelmann and I are just alike when it comes to an evening&#8217;s
amusement? Do you think the earth claims me as soon as I
see a tear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him go,&#8221; whispered Benda to the girl, &#8220;he is right. Don&#8217;t
bring an artificial light into this darkness; it serves his purpose;
let him do with it as he pleases.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore looked at Benda with wide-opened eyes. &#8220;Darkness?
What do you mean? The fire then was merely a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp,&#8221;
she said, her eyes shining with pride, &#8220;I see him full of light.&#8221;
Daniel had heard what she said. &#8220;Really, Eleanore?&#8221; he asked
with greedy curiosity.</p>

<p>She nodded: &#8220;Really, Daniel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For that you can have anything you want from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then I beg you and Benda to come over to our house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>Father will be delighted to see you, and we will have something
to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine. That sounds good to me. Addio, Wurzelmann, and remember
me to the girls. You are coming along, aren&#8217;t you, Friedrich?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benda first made a few polite remarks, and then said he would
accept.</p>

<p>&#8220;You liked it then, did you, Eleanore?&#8221; asked Daniel, as they
walked along the street.</p>

<p>Eleanore was silent. To Daniel her silence was moving. But
he soon forgot the impression it made on him; and it was a long,
long while, indeed even years, before he recalled this scene.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>Jordan had taken Gertrude home. He was very careful not to
ask her any questions that would cause her pain. On reaching the
house he lighted a lamp and helped her take off her cloak.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you feel?&#8221; he asked in a kindly tone, &#8220;are you better?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude turned to one side, and sat down on a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll drink a cup of hot tea,&#8221; continued the old man;
&#8220;then my child will go to bed, and to-morrow morning she will be
all right again. Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude got up. &#8220;Father,&#8221; she sighed, and felt around for the
tea table as a means of support.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gertrude, what is the matter?&#8221; cried Jordan in dismay.</p>

<p>She moved the upper part of her body in her characteristic
way&mdash;as though it were limp and she were trying to drag it along
with her&mdash;and a faint smile came over her face. All of a sudden
she burst out crying and ran to her room. Jordan heard her bolt
the door, looked anxiously before him, waited a moment or two,
and then crept up to her door on his tiptoes.</p>

<p>He placed his hands under his chin and listened. Gertrude was
crying. It was an even and touching cry, not so much filled with
grief as her sobs generally were, and seemed to be expiratory
rather than the reverse.</p>

<p>As Jordan let the lonely, unhappy, and impenetrable life of his
daughter pass by him in mental review, he became painfully aware
of the fact that this was the first time in her life that she had
ever heard real music. &#8220;Is it possible?&#8221; he asked. He tried to
think of another time that would make him disbelieve the accuracy
of his unpleasant observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p><p>He said to himself: Her case is simple; the hitherto unknown
sweetness and power concealed in the ensemble playing of the
violins, the euphony of the orchestra, and the beauty of the melody
with all its fateful directness has made the same impression on her
that the sunlight makes on a person from whose eyes a cataract has
just been removed. Her soul has suffered from hunger; that is
where the trouble lies. She has struggled too fiercely with the
incomprehensible and the intangible.</p>

<p>His instinct of love told him that the best thing to do was to
let her cry. It will do her good; it will relieve her soul. He
pulled a chair up to her door, sat down, and listened. When he
could no longer hear her crying, his heart grew easier.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>Eleanore was right. Her father was quite pleased to see Daniel
and Benda. &#8220;I am proud of you,&#8221; he said to Daniel, &#8220;and for
your visit to me I thank you. I feel flattered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had stayed a half hour longer, you might feel differently
about it,&#8221; replied Daniel.</p>

<p>Eleanore gave her father a brief account of what had taken
place at the concert. Jordan listened attentively, looked at Daniel,
and, with a wrinkle on his forehead, said, &#8220;Is it possible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is possible; it had to happen,&#8221; said Daniel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if it had to happen, it is a good thing that it is over,&#8221;
was the dispassionate response.</p>

<p>Eleanore took her father&#8217;s hand; the back of it was covered with
big yellow spots; she kissed it. Then she set the table, got everything
ready for the meal, went in and out of the room in a most
cheerful way, and did not forget to put the water on the stove
to boil. She had asked about Gertrude as soon as she came home,
but for some reason or other her father seemed disinclined to say
anything on the subject, from which Eleanore inferred that there
was nothing seriously wrong.</p>

<p>Finally they sat down at the table. Eleanore was quite pleased
to see the three men whom she liked so much gathered together
in this way. There was a feeling of gratitude in her heart toward
each one of them. But she was also hungry: she ate four
sandwiches, one right after the other. When she saw that Daniel
was not eating, she stepped up behind his chair, bent over him so
far that the loose flowing hair from her temples tickled his face,
and said: &#8220;Are you embarrassed? Or don&#8217;t you like the way the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>sausages have been prepared? Would you like something else?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel evaded the questions; he was out of sorts. And yet in
the bottom of his heart the contact with the girl made a pleasing
impression on him; it was in truth almost a saving impression.
For his thoughts continually and obstinately returned to the girl
who had fled, and whose presence he missed without exactly wishing
that she were at the table with the others.</p>

<p>Benda spoke of the political changes that might, he feared, take
place because of the death of Gambetta. Jordan, who always took
a warm interest in the affairs of the Fatherland, made a number
of true and humane remarks about the tense feeling then existing
between France and Germany, whereupon the door to Gertrude&#8217;s
room opened and Gertrude herself stood on the threshold.</p>

<p>Deep silence filled the room; they all looked at her.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, she was not wearing the dress she had on
at the concert. She had put on the Nile green dress, the one in
which Daniel saw her for the first time. Jordan and Eleanore
hardly noticed the change; they were too much absorbed in the
expression on the girl&#8217;s face. Daniel was also astonished; he could
not look away.</p>

<p>Her expression had become softer, freer, brighter. The unrest
in which her face had heretofore been clouded had disappeared.
Even the outlines of her face seemed to have changed: the arch of
her eyebrows was higher, the oval of her cheeks more delicate.</p>

<p>She leaned against the door; she even leaned her head against the
door. Her left hand, hanging at her side, seemed indolent, limp,
indifferent. Her right hand was pressed against her bosom.
Standing in this position, she studied the faces of those who were
sitting at the table, while a timid and gentle smile played about her
lips.</p>

<p>Jordan&#8217;s first suspicion was that she had lost her mind. He
sprang up, and hastened over to her. But she gave him her hand,
and offered no resistance at all to being led over to the table.</p>

<p>Suddenly she fixed her silent gaze on Daniel. He got up involuntarily,
and seized the back of his chair. His colour changed;
he distorted the corners of his mouth; he was nervous. But when
Gertrude withdrew her hand from her father&#8217;s and extended it
to him, and when he took it and his eye met hers&mdash;he could not
help but look at her&mdash;his solicitude vanished. For what he read
in her eyes was an unreserved and irrevocable capitulation of her
whole self, and Daniel was the victor. His face grew gentle,
grateful, dreamy, and resplendent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p><p>It was not merely the sensuous charm revealed in the feeling
which Gertrude betrayed that moved him: it was the fact that she
came as she had come, a penitent and a convert. The sublime
conviction that he had been able to transform a soul and awaken it
to new life touched him deeply.</p>

<p>This it was that drew him to Gertrude more than her countenance,
her expression, and her body combined. And now he saw
all three&mdash;her countenance, her expression, and her body.</p>

<p>Jordan had a foreboding of something. He felt that he would
have to take the girl in his arms and flee with her. Pictures of
future misfortune crowded upon his imagination; the hope he had
cherished for Gertrude was crushed to the earth.</p>

<p>Benda stared at his plate in silence. Nevertheless, just as if
he had other eyes than those with which he saw earthly things, he
noticed that Eleanore&#8217;s hands and lips were trembling, that with
each succeeding second she grew paler, that she cast a distrustful
glance first at her father, then at her sister, and then at Daniel,
and that she finally, as if overcome with a feeling of exhaustion,
slipped away from her place by the table lamp, stole into a corner,
and sat down on the hassock.</p>

<p>But after they had all resumed their seats at the table, Gertrude
sitting between Benda and her father, Eleanore came up and sat
down next to Daniel. She never took her eyes off Gertrude;
she looked at her in breathless surprise, Gertrude smiled as she
had smiled when leaning against the door, timidly and passionately.</p>

<p>From that moment on, the conversation lagged, Benda suggested
to his friend that it was time for them to leave. They thanked
Jordan for his hospitality and departed. Jordan accompanied them
down the stairs and unlocked the front door. When he returned,
Eleanore was just going to her room: &#8220;Well, Eleanore, are you
not going to say good-night?&#8221; he called after her.</p>

<p>She turned around, nodded conventionally, and closed the door.</p>

<p>Gertrude was still sitting at the table. Jordan was walking up
and down the room. Suddenly she sprang up, stepped in his way,
forced him to stop, threw her arms about his neck, and kissed him
on the forehead. She had never done that before.</p>

<p>She too had gone to sleep. Jordan felt terribly alone. He
heard the street door open and close; he heard some one enter. It
was Benno. Jordan thought that his son would come in, for he
must have seen the light through the crack of the door. But Benno
evidently had no desire to see his father. He went to his room at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>the other end of the hall, and closed the door behind him just as
if he were a servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all three in bed,&#8221; thought Jordan to himself, &#8220;and
what do I know about them?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head, removed the hanging lamp from its frame,
and locked the room, holding the lamp very carefully as he did so.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Eleanore had not seen Eberhard von Auffenberg for a number of
weeks. He wrote her a card, asking for the privilege of meeting
her somewhere. The place in fact was always the same&mdash;the
bridge at the gate to the Zo&ouml;logical Garden. Immediately after
sunset she betook herself to that point. It was a warm March
evening; there was not a breath of wind; the sky was covered with
clouds.</p>

<p>They strolled up the castle hill, and when they had reached the
parapet, Eleanore said, gently laughing: &#8220;Now listen, I have talked
enough; you say something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is so pleasant to be silent with you,&#8221; replied Eberhard in a
downcast mood.</p>

<p>Filled with a disagreeable premonition, Eleanore sought out
one of the many hundreds of lights dimly flickering down in the
city, fixed her eyes on it, and stubbornly refused to look at any
other earthly object.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I appeal to you at this hour,&#8221; the young Baron finally began,
&#8220;it is to a certain extent exactly as if I were appealing to the
Supreme Court. My expectations in life have, with one single
exception, been utterly and irrevocably crushed. It depends quite
upon you, Eleanore, whether I am to become and remain a useless
parasite of human society, or a man who has firmly decided to
pay for his share of happiness by an equal amount of honest work.
I offer you everything I have. It is not much, but I offer it to
you without haggling and forever. You and you alone can save
me. That is what I wanted to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up at the clouds, leaning on his cane, which he had
placed behind his back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have forbidden you to speak of this,&#8221; whispered Eleanore
in profound dismay, &#8220;and you promised me that you would not say
anything about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave you my promise because I loved you; I break it for the
same reason,&#8221; replied Eberhard. &#8220;I feel that such a promise is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>the act of a foolish child, when the building up or the tearing
down of a human life depends upon it. If you are of a different
opinion, I can only beg your pardon. Probably I have been
mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore shook her head; she was grieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was my plan to go to England with you, and there we would
be married,&#8221; continued Eberhard. &#8220;It is quite impossible for me
to get married here: I loathe this city. It is impossible, because if
I did my people would in all probability set up some claims to
which they are no longer entitled and for which I would fight.
The mere thought of doing this repels me. And it is also impossible
because&nbsp;...&#8221; at this he stopped and bit his lips.</p>

<p>Eleanore looked at him; she was filled with curiosity. His
pedantic enumeration of the various hindrances as well as the
romanticism of his plans amused her. When she detected the
expression of downright grief in his face, she felt sorry for him.
She came one step nearer to him; he took her hand, bowed, and
pressed his lips to her fingers. She jerked her hand back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fatal circumstances have placed me in a most humiliating
situation; if I am not to succumb to them, I must shake them off
at once,&#8221; said Eberhard anxiously. &#8220;I was inexperienced; I have
been deceived. There is a person connected with my case who
hardly deserves the name of a human being; he is a monster in
the garb of an honest citizen. I have not the faintest idea what
I am to do next, Eleanore. I must leave at once. In a strange
country I may regain my strength and mental clearness. With
you I could defy the universe. Believe in me, have confidence in
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore let her head sink. The despair of this usually reserved
man touched her heart. Her mouth twitched as she sought for
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot get married, Eberhard,&#8221; she said, &#8220;really, I cannot.
I did not entice you to me; you dare not reproach me. I have
tried to make my attitude toward you perfectly clear from the very
first time I met you. I cannot get married; I cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>For five or six minutes there was a silence that was interrupted
only by human voices in the distance and the sound of carriages
from the streets down in the city. In the compassion that Eleanore
after all felt for Eberhard she sensed the harshness of her unqualified
refusal. She looked at him courageously, firmly, and said: &#8220;It
is not obstinacy on my part, Eberhard; nor is it stupid anxiety, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>imagination, nor lack of respect. Truth to tell I have a very high
opinion of you. But there must be something quite unnatural
about me, for you see that I loathe the very idea of getting married.
I detest the thought of living with a man. I like you, but when
you touch me as you did a little while ago when you kissed my
hand, a shudder runs through my whole body.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eberhard looked at her in astonishment; he was morose, too.</p>

<p>She continued: &#8220;It has been in me since my childhood; perhaps
I was born with it, just as other people are born with a physical
defect. It may be that I have been this way ever since a certain
day in my life. It was an autumn evening in Pappenheim, where
my aunt then lived. My sister Gertrude and I were walking in a
great fruit garden; we came to a thorn hedge, and sitting by the
hedge was an old woman. My father and mother were far away,
and the old woman said to my sister, then about seven: Be on your
guard against everything that sings and rings. To me she said: Be
careful never to have a child. The next day the woman was found
dead under the hedge. She was over ninety years old, and for
more than fifty years she had peddled herbs in Altm&uuml;hltal. I
naturally had not the vaguest idea what she meant at the time by
&#8216;having a child,&#8217; but her remark stuck in my heart like an arrow.
It grew up with me; it became a part of me. And when I learned
what it meant, it was a picture by the side of the picture of death.
Now you must not think that I have gone through life thus far
filled with a feeling of despicable fear. Not at all. I simply
have no desires. The idea does not attract me. If it ever does,
many questions will I ask about life and death! I will laugh at
the old woman under the hedge and do what I must.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spoke these last words, her face took on a strangely
chaste and fanciful expression. Eberhard could not take his eyes
from her. &#8220;Ah, there are after all fairy creatures on this flat, stale,
and unprofitable earth,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;enchanted princesses, mysterious
Melusinas.&#8221; He smiled somewhat distrustfully&mdash;as a matter
of habit. But from this moment his frank, open, wooing attachment
to the girl was transformed into a consuming passion.</p>

<p>He was proud, and man enough to subdue his feelings. But
he yearned more than ever, and was tortured by his yearnings to
know something more than the vague knowledge he had at present
about that glass case, that spirit-chest in which, so near and yet
so far, this lovely creature lived, impervious to the touch of mortal
hands and immune to the flames of love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;You are rejecting me, then?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it is at least advisable that for the time being we avoid
each other&#8217;s presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Advisable for me, you think. And for the time being? How
am I to interpret that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let us say for five years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why exactly five years? Why not twenty? Why not fifty?
It would be all the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me that five years is just the right amount of time,
Eberhard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Five years! Each year has twelve times thirty, fifty-two times
seven days. Why, the arithmetic of it is enough to make a man
lose his mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it must be five years,&#8221; said Eleanore gently though firmly.
&#8220;In five years I will not have changed. And if I am just the same
in five years from now, why, we&#8217;ll talk it over again. I must not
exclude myself from the world forever. My father often says:
What looks like fate at Easter is a mere whim by Pentecost. I
prefer to wait until Pentecost and not to forget my friend in the
meantime.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him her hand with a smile.</p>

<p>He shook his head: &#8220;No, I can&#8217;t take your hand; another one of
those shudders will run through you if I do. Farewell, Eleanore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you too, Eberhard, farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Eberhard started down the hill. Suddenly he stopped, turned
around, and said: &#8220;Just one thing more. That musician&mdash;Nothafft
is his name, isn&#8217;t it?&mdash;is engaged to your sister, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Gertrude and Daniel will get married some day. But who
told you about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The musician himself was in a restaurant. The fellows were
drinking, and he was so incautious as to raise his glass, and, somewhat
after the fashion of an intoxicated drum-major, he himself
drank to Gertrude&#8217;s health. For some time there was talk of his
marrying you. It is much better as it is. I can&#8217;t stand artists. I
can&#8217;t even have due respect for them, these indiscreet hotspurs.
Good night, Eleanore.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he vanished in the darkness.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">One</span> evening Daniel called on Benda to take leave of him for
a long while.</p>

<p>Just as he was about to enter the front gate, he saw Herr
Carovius&#8217;s dog standing there showing his teeth. The beast&#8217;s bloodshot
eyes were fixed on a ten-year old girl who was likewise on
the point of entering the house, but, afraid of the dog, she did
not dare take another step. The animal had dragged his chain
along behind him, and stood there now, snarling in a most vicious
way.</p>

<p>Daniel took the child by the hand and led it back a few steps,
after he had frightened the dog into silence by some rough commands.
&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he asked the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dorothea D&ouml;derlein,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Daniel. He could not help but laugh, for there was
a comic tone of precociousness in the girl&#8217;s manner of speaking.
But she was a very pretty child. A sly, smiling little face peeped
out from under her hood, and her velvet mantle with great pearl
buttons enshrouded a dainty figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have been in bed long ago, Dorothea,&#8221; said Daniel.
&#8220;What will the night watchman think when he comes along and
finds you up? He will take you by the collar, and lead you off
to jail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea told him why she was still up and why she was alone.
She had been visiting a school friend, and the maid who called
for her wanted to get a loaf of bread from the bakery before
going up stairs. She related the story of her meeting with the
dog with so much coquetry and detail that Daniel was delighted at
the contrast between this rodomontade and the quaking anxiety in
which he first found her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a fraud, Dorothea,&#8221; said Daniel, and called to mind the
unpleasant sensation she aroused in him when he saw her for the
first time years ago.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the maid had come up with the loaf of bread;
she looked with astonishment at the two as they stood there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>gossiping, and immediately took the child into her charge, conscious
as she was of her own dilatoriness. With a few piercing
shrieks she drove C&aelig;sar back from the gate, and as he ran across
the street Dorothea cast one triumphant glance back at Daniel,
feeling that she had proved to him that she was not the least
afraid of the dog.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Frau Benda opened the door, closed it without saying a word,
and went into her room. She had had a violent quarrel with her
son, who had just informed her that he had accepted the invitation
of a learned society to come to England and settle down. He was
to start at the end of spring. Frau Benda was tired of travelling;
she shuddered at the thought of moving. The separation from
Friedrich seemed intolerable to her; and in his flight from the
Fatherland she saw a final and premature renunciation of all the opportunities
that might in the end present themselves to him at home.</p>

<p>She was convinced that the men who had done him injustice
would in time come to see the error of their ways and make amends
for their miscalculations. She was particularly anxious that he
be patient until satisfaction had been done him. Moreover, she
knew his plans, and trembled at the risks to which he was voluntarily
exposing himself: she felt that he was undertaking a task for
which he had not had the practical experience.</p>

<p>But his decision was irrevocable. That he had never said a
word about it to Daniel, had not even insinuated that he was thinking
of making a change, was due to the peculiar onesideness of their
present relation to each other.</p>

<p>Laughing heartily, Daniel told of his meeting with little Dorothea.
&#8220;She looks to me as though she will give old D&ouml;derlein a
good deal to think about in the days to come,&#8221; said Daniel.</p>

<p>&#8220;You played him a pretty scurvy trick, the old D&ouml;derlein,&#8221; replied
Benda. &#8220;The night after the public rehearsal I heard him
walking up and down for hours right under my bedroom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You feel sorry for him, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were you, I would go to him and beg his pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really mean it?&#8221; exclaimed Daniel. Benda said nothing.
Daniel continued: &#8220;To tell the truth, I should be grateful
to him. It is due to his efforts that I have come to see, more
quickly than I otherwise would have done, that those were two impossible
imitations to which I wanted to assure a place in the sun.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>They may throw me down if they wish; I&#8217;ll get up again, depend
upon it, if, and even if, I have in the meantime gulped down the
whole earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benda smiled a gracious smile. &#8220;Yes, you die at each fall, and
at each come-back you appear a new-made man,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That
is fine. But a D&ouml;derlein cannot come back, once his contemporaries
have thrown him over. The very thing that means a new idea to
you spells his ruin; what gives you pleasure, voluptuous pleasure, is
death to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-e-s,&#8221; mumbled Daniel, &#8220;and yet, what good is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The spirit of nature, the spirit of God, is a total stranger to
such conceptions as harmfulness and usefulness,&#8221; replied Benda in
a tone of serious reflection. &#8220;He lives, and that is about all you
can say. So far as I am concerned, I have not the slightest reason
to defend a D&ouml;derlein in your presence.&#8221; He was silent for a
moment and took a deep breath. &#8220;I cannot speak more distinctly;
somehow or other I cannot quite find the right words,&#8221; he continued
in a disconcerted way, &#8220;but the point is, the man has committed
a crime against a woman, a crime so malicious, subtle, and
na&iuml;ve, that he deserves every stigma with which it is possible to
brand him, and even then he would not be adequately punished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; exclaimed Daniel, &#8220;he is not only a miserable musician.
And that is the way it always is. They are all like that.
Oh, these bitter-sweet, grinning, pajama-bred, match-making,
ninnying, super-smart manikins&mdash;it makes your blood curdle to look
at one of them. And yet a real man has got to run the gauntlet
before them his whole life long, and down through their narrow
little alleys at that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; said Benda with bowed head. &#8220;It is a tough, clammy
poison pap. If you stir it with your finger, you will stick fast,
and it will suck the very marrow out of your bones. But you are
speaking for the time being without precise knowledge of all the
pertinent material, as we say in science. During my study of the
cells of plants and animals, I came to see that a so-called fundamental
procreation was out of the question. I gave expression to
this view in a circle of professional colleagues. They laughed at
me. To-day it is no longer possible to oppose the theory I then
advanced. One of my former friends succeeded in making certain
combinations of acetic acid, crystallised by artificial means. When
he made his great discovery known, one of the assembled gentlemen
cried out: &#8216;Be careful, doctorette, or your amido atoms will
get out of their cage.&#8217; That is a sample of the base and treacherous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>fashion in which we are treated by the very people who we might
think were our warmest friends, for they are apparently trying to
reach the same goal that we are. But you! The world may
reject you, and you still have what no one can take from you.
I have to wait in patience until a judge hands down a decision
either condemning me or redeeming me. You? Between you
and me there is the same difference that exists between the seed
which, sunk into the earth, shoots up whether it rains or shines, and
some kind of a utensil which rusts in the store because no one buys
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up and said: &#8220;You are the more fortunate of us two, it
behooves me therefore to be the more merciful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel could make no reply that would console him.</p>

<p>As he went home, he thought of the fidelity and the constant
but unassuming help he had received from Benda. He thought
of the refined and delicate consideration of his friend. He
thought especially of that extraordinary courtesy which was so
marked in him, that, for example, while laughing at a good joke,
Benda would stop with open mouth if some one resumed the conversation:
he did not wish to lose anything another might wish to
say to him.</p>

<p>He stopped. It seemed to him that he had neglected the opportunity
to put an especially reassuring, cordial, and unforgettable
force into his final handshake. He would have liked to turn back.
But it is not the custom to turn back; no one in truth can do it.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Daniel did not wish to take the mask of Zingarella with him
on his tours. To expose the fragile material to all the risks associated
with a fortuitous life on the road seemed to him an act
of impiety. He had consequently promised Eleanore to leave the
mask with her in Jordan&#8217;s house during his absence.</p>

<p>Eleanore opened the door; Daniel entered. Gertrude arose
from her seat at the table, and came up to meet him. Her face
showed, as it always did when she saw him, unmistakable traces of
resignation, willingness, submissiveness.</p>

<p>Daniel walked over to the table, took the newspaper wrapping
from the mask, and held it up in the light of the lamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;How beautiful!&#8221; exclaimed Gertrude, whose senses were now
delighted at the sight of any object that appealed to one&#8217;s feelings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, take it, then, Gertrude,&#8221; said Eleanore, as she leaned both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>elbows on the top of the table. &#8220;Keep it with you,&#8221; she continued
somewhat tensely, when she noticed that Gertrude was looking at
Daniel as if to say, &#8220;May I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t he give it to both of us?&#8221; replied Gertrude with a
covetous smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, he simply mentioned me for courtesy&#8217;s sake,&#8221; said
Eleanore, quite positively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanore, I can scarcely tell you how I feel toward you,&#8221; said
Daniel, half confused, half angry, and then stopped with conspicuous
suddenness when the fiery blue of her eyes fell upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; she whispered in astonishment, &#8220;you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you,&#8221; he replied emphatically. &#8220;Later I can tell everybody;
to-day it is true in a double sense: you seem to me just like
a sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had laid the mask to one side and extended his left hand to
Eleanore, and then, hesitating at first, he gave Gertrude his right
hand with a most decisive gesture.</p>

<p>Eleanore straightened up, took the mask of Zingarella, and held it
up before her face. &#8220;Little Brother,&#8221; she cried out in a teasing
tone. The pale, sweet stone face was wonderful to behold, as it
was raised above the body that was pulsing with life.</p>

<p>And Gertrude&mdash;for one second she hung on Daniel&#8217;s gaze, a
sigh as deep as the murmuring of the sea sounded in her bosom,
and then she lay in his arms. He kissed her without saying a word.
His face was gloomy, his brow wrinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Brother&#8221; sounded out from behind the mask. But there
was no banter in the expression; it was much more like a complaint,
a revelation of anguish: &#8220;Little Brother!&#8221;</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Daniel had left the city long ago. Eleanore chanced to meet
Herr Carovius. He forced her to stop, conducted himself in such
a familiar way, and talked in such a loud voice that the passersby
simpered. He asked all about the young master, meaning
Daniel.</p>

<p>He told her that &#8220;the good Eberhard&#8221;&mdash;it was his way of referring
to Baron von Auffenberg&mdash;had gone to Munich for a few
months, and was taking up with spiritists and theosophists.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is his way of having a fling,&#8221; said Herr Carovius, grinning
from ear to ear. &#8220;In former times, when young noblemen wished
to complete their education and have a little lark at the same time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>they made the grand tour over Europe. Now-a-days they become
penny-a-liners, or they go in for table-tipping. Humanity is on
the decline, my charming little girl. To study the flower of the
nation at close range is no longer an edifying occupation. It is
rotten, as rotten, I tell you, as last winter&#8217;s apples. There is consequently
no greater pleasure than to make such a young chap
dance. You play, he dances; you whistle, he retrieves. It is a
real treat!&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed hysterically, and then had a coughing spell. He
coughed so violently that the black cord suspended from his nose-glasses
became tangled about a button on his great coat, and his
glasses fell from his nose. In his awkwardness, intensified by his
short-sightedness, he fumbled the button and the cord with his
bony fingers until Eleanore came to the rescue. One move, and
everything was again in order.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius was struck dumb with surprise. He would never
have imagined that a young girl could be so natural and unembarrassed.
He suspected a trap: was she making fun of him, or
did she wish to do him harm? It had never occurred to him that
one might voluntarily assist him when in distress.</p>

<p>Suddenly he became ashamed of himself; he lifted his eyes and
smiled like a simpleton; he cast a glance of almost dog-like tenderness
at Eleanore. And then, without saying a word, without even
saying good-bye to her, he hastened across the street to hide as soon
as he might in some obscure corner.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>One afternoon in the last week of August, the R&uuml;diger sisters
sent the boy who attended to their garden over to Eleanore with
the urgent request that she call as soon as she possibly could. Feeling
that some misfortune had befallen Daniel and that the sisters
wished to tell her about it, Eleanore was not slow about making up
her mind: exactly one quarter of an hour later she entered the
R&uuml;digers&#8217; front door.</p>

<p>A lamentable sight greeted her. Each of the three sisters was
sitting in a high-backed chair, her arms hanging lifeless from
her sides. The curtains were drawn; in the shaded light their
faces looked like mummies. Nor was the general impression measurably
brightened by the &#8220;Medea,&#8221; the &#8220;Iphigenie,&#8221; and the
&#8220;Roman Woman&#8221; that hung on the wall, copies of the paintings of
their idol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p><p>Eleanore&#8217;s greeting was not returned. She did not dare leave
without finding what was the matter, and the silence with which
she was received was broken only when she herself decided to ask
some questions.</p>

<p>Fr&auml;ulein Jasmina took out her handkerchief and dried her eyes.
Fr&auml;ulein Saloma looked around somewhat like a judge at a session
of court. And then she began to speak: &#8220;We three lonely women,
forgotten by the world, have asked you to come to our house so
that we might tell you of a crime that has been committed in our
innocent home. We never heard of it until this morning. It is
such an unexampled, gruesome, abominable deed that we have been
sitting here ever since it was brought to our attention, wringing our
hands in vain attempt to make up our minds as to what course we
should pursue.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fr&auml;ulein Jasmina and Fr&auml;ulein Albertina nodded their heads in
sadness and without looking up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we put the unfortunate girl out of the house?&#8221; continued
Fr&auml;ulein Saloma, &#8220;can we, sisters? No! Can we afford to keep
her? No! What are we to do then? She is an orphan; she is
all alone, abandoned by her infamous seducer, and exposed to
unmitigated shame. What are we to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you,&#8221; said Fr&auml;ulein Saloma turning to Eleanore, &#8220;you
who are bound to that gifted monster by ties the precise nature of
which we are in no position to judge, you are to show us a way out
of this labyrinth of our affliction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I only knew what you are talking about,&#8221; said Eleanore,
a great burden falling from her heart as she realised that her initial
fears were groundless. &#8220;By the monster you evidently mean Daniel
Nothafft. What crime has he committed?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fr&auml;ulein Saloma was indignant at the flippancy of her manner.
She rose to her full stature, and said with punitive lips: &#8220;He has
made our maid an ordinary prostitute, and the consequences are no
longer to be concealed. Do you know what we are talking about
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore uttered a faint &#8220;Oh!&#8221; and blushed to the roots of her
hair. In her embarrassment she opened her mouth to laugh, but
she came very near to crying.</p>

<p>Her saddened feelings slowly crept back to Daniel, and as the
picture of him rose before her mind&#8217;s eye, she turned from it in
disgust. But she did not wish to allow this picture to remain in her
memory: it was too flabby, petty, and selfish. Before she knew
what she was doing, she, as a woman, had pardoned him. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>she shuddered, opened wide her eyes, and resumed her accustomed
cheerfulness. She was again in complete control of herself.</p>

<p>The court had in the meanwhile examined the silent woman
with stern scrutiny: &#8220;Where is Daniel Nothafft at present?&#8221; asked
Fr&auml;ulein Saloma.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; replied Eleanore, &#8220;he hasn&#8217;t written for over
three weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must request you to inform him at once of the condition of
the prostitute, for so long as such a person is in our house, we
cannot sleep at night nor rest by day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry that you take the matter so to heart,&#8221; said Eleanore,
&#8220;and it is a rather disagreeable affair. But I have no right to mix
myself up in it, nor have I the least desire to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three sisters received this statement with despair; they wrung
their hands. They would rather die, they said, than meet this
voluptuary face to face again; they would endure all manner of
martyrdom before they would have him come in. All three spoke
at once; they threatened Eleanore; they implored her. Jasmina
told with bated breath how Meta had come to them and confessed
the whole business. Albertina swore that there was not another
living soul on earth who could help them out of this shameless
situation. Saloma said that there was nothing for them to do but
to send the wicked creature back to the streets where she belonged.</p>

<p>Eleanore was silent. She had fixed her eyes on the &#8220;Medea,&#8221; and
was doing some hard thinking. Finally she came to a conclusion:
she asked whether she might speak to Meta. Filled at once with
anxiety and hope, Saloma asked her what she wanted with Meta.
She replied that she would tell them later what her purpose was.
Fr&auml;ulein Jasmina showed her the way to Meta&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>When Meta caught sight of Eleanore, her features became at
once beclouded in sombre amazement.</p>

<p>She was sitting at the open window of her attic room knitting.
She got up and looked into the face of the beautiful girl without
saying a word. Eleanore was moved on seeing the tall, youthful
figure, and yet it was quite impossible for her to subdue a feeling
of horror.</p>

<p>At Eleanore&#8217;s very first words, Meta began to sob. Eleanore
comforted her; she asked her where she was planning to go during
her confinement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, there are institutions,&#8221; she murmured, holding her apron
before her face, &#8220;I can go to one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore sat down on the side of the bed. She unrolled her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>plans to the girl with a delicacy and consideration just as if she
were speaking to a pampered lady. She spoke with a silver-clear
vivacity just as if she were discussing some hardy prank.
Meta looked at her at first with the air of one oppressed; later she
assumed the attitude of a grateful listener.</p>

<p>Pained by the ethereal and inhuman primness of her three employers,
angry at the man who had abandoned her to her present
fate, and fighting against the reproaches of her own conscience,
Meta became as wax in Eleanore&#8217;s hands, submissive, obedient, and
appreciative.</p>

<p>The R&uuml;diger sisters, all but bursting with curiosity to know
what Eleanore had in mind, could draw nothing from her other
than that she was going to take Meta away and that Meta was
agreed.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>It was Eleanore&#8217;s intention to take the pregnant girl to Daniel&#8217;s
mother at Eschenbach.</p>

<p>She knew of the dissension between Daniel and his mother.
She knew that the two avoided each other&#8217;s presence; that Daniel
in his defiance felt it his duty to avenge himself for the lack of
love on the part of his mother. Back of the picture of the unloving
and impatient son she saw that of an old woman worrying
her life away in silent care.</p>

<p>She had often given way to a painful feeling of sympathy when
she thought of the unknown mother of her friend. It seemed
to her now as if she could play the r&ocirc;le of an emissary of reconciliation;
as if it were her duty to take the deserted woman here
to the deserted woman there; as if she were called to take the
mother-to-be to the mother who had just reasons for regretting that
she had ever been a mother.</p>

<p>It seemed to her as if she must create a bond which could not
even be sundered by crime, to say nothing of misunderstanding or
caprice; it seemed to her that Daniel had to effect a reconciliation
in the home of the R&uuml;digers as well as in that of his mother;
and that, conscious as she was of doing what was right, she would
meet with no opposition, would have no settling of accounts to
fear.</p>

<p>She also took the practical side of the matter into careful consideration:
Meta would have no trouble in making her living in
Eschenbach; she could help Daniel&#8217;s mother, or she could do day
work among the peasants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p><p>When the child was born, Daniel&#8217;s mother would have a picture
of young life to look at; it would alleviate her longing; it would
appease her bitterness to see a child of Daniel&#8217;s own blood.</p>

<p>Eleanore told the people at home that she was going on an
excursion with a school friend to the Ansbach country. She
studied the time-table, and wrote a postcard to Meta telling her
to be at the station at eight o&#8217;clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Jordan approved of Eleanore&#8217;s outing, though he warned her
against bandits and cold drinks. Gertrude was not wholly without
suspicion. She had a feeling that something was wrong, that
these unspoken words referred to Daniel, for she was always thinking
about him.</p>

<p>If she received a letter from him, which was very rare, she
would let it lie on the table for a long while, imagining that it
was full of the most glorious declarations of his love for her, expressed
in language which she could not command. In a sort of
moon-struck ecstasy she made an inner, dreamed music out of what
he wrote.</p>

<p>When she read his letter, she was satisfied merely to see the
words he had written and to feel the paper on which his hand had
rested. She submitted in silence to the laws of his nature, which
would not permit him to be excessive in his remarks or unusually
communicative. Each of his dry reports was a tiding of glad
joy to her, though her own replies were just as dry, giving not
the slightest picture of the enraptured soul from which they
came.</p>

<p>She felt that Eleanore was lying, and that the lie she was telling
was somehow connected with Daniel. That is why she went up
to Eleanore&#8217;s bed in the dead of night, and whispered into her
ear: &#8220;Tell me, Eleanore, has anything happened to Daniel?&#8221;</p>

<p>But before Eleanore could reply, reassured by her sister&#8217;s
astonished behaviour, and angry at herself for having suspected
Eleanore of a falsehood, she hurried back to her own bed. She
had come to think more and more of her sister every day.</p>

<p>&#8220;How she must love him,&#8221; thought Eleanore to herself, and
buried her smiling face in the pillow.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>&#8220;Wait for me at the fountain,&#8221; said Eleanore to her companion,
as she crossed the market place in Eschenbach at midday: &#8220;I&#8217;ll call
for you as soon as everything has been discussed.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p><p>The coachman pointed out the little house of the widow
Nothafft.</p>

<p>A woman with a stern face and unusually large eyebrows asked
her what she wanted as she entered the little shop, which smelled of
vinegar and cheese.</p>

<p>Eleanore replied that she would like to talk with her for a few
minutes quite undisturbed and alone.</p>

<p>The profound seriousness of Marian&#8217;s features, which resembled
more than anything else an incurable suffering, did not
disappear. She closed the shop and took Eleanore into the living
room, and, without saying a word, pointed to one chair and took
another herself.</p>

<p>Above the leather sofa hung the picture of Gottfried Nothafft.
Eleanore looked at it for a long while.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear mother,&#8221; she finally began, laying her hand on Marian&#8217;s
knee. &#8220;I am bringing you something from Daniel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marian twitched. &#8220;Good or bad?&#8221; she asked. She had not
heard from Daniel for twenty-two months. &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;
she asked, &#8220;what have you to do with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore saw at once that she would have to be extremely
cautious if she did not wish to offend the sensitive&mdash;and offended&mdash;woman
by some inconsiderate remark. With all the discrimination
she could command she laid her case before Daniel&#8217;s mother.</p>

<p>And behold&mdash;the unusual became usual, just as the natural
seemed strange. Eleanore pictured Daniel&#8217;s hardships and rise to
fame, boasted loyally of his talents and of the enthusiasm for
him of those who believed in him, referred to his future renown,
and insisted that all his guilt, including that toward his mother, be
forgotten and forgiven.</p>

<p>Marian reviewed the past; she understood a great many things
now that were not clear to her years ago; she understood Daniel
better; she understood virtually everything, except this girl&#8217;s
relation to him and the girl herself. If it was peculiar that this
strange woman had to come to her to tell her who Daniel was
and what he meant to the people, it was wholly inexplicable that
she had brought some one with her who had been the sweetheart
of the very man for whom she now showed unreserved affection.</p>

<p>Eleanore read Marian&#8217;s face and became a trifle more deliberate.
It occurred to her, too, to ask herself a few questions: What
am I, any way? What is the matter with me?</p>

<p>She could not give a satisfactory answer to these questions. His
friend? He my friend? The words seemed to contain too much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>peace and calm. Brother? Companion? Either of these words
brought up pictures of intimate association, inner relationship.
Little Brother! Yes, that is what she had called out to him once
from behind the mask. Well then: Little sister behind the mask?</p>

<p>Yes, that was what it should be: Little sister behind the mask.
She had to have a hiding place for so many things of which she
had only a vague presentiment and which in truth she did not
care to visualise in brighter outlines. A subdued heart, a captured
heart&mdash;it glows, it cools off, you lift it up, you weigh it down just
as fate decrees. To be patient, not to betray anything, that was
the all-important point: Little sister behind the mask&mdash;that was the
idea.</p>

<p>Marian said: &#8220;My child, God himself has inspired you with
the idea of coming to me and telling me about Daniel. I will put
fresh flowers in the window as I did some time ago, and I will leave
the front door open so that the swallows can fly in and build their
nests. Perhaps he will think then from time to time of his
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she asked to see Meta. Eleanore went out, and returned
in a few minutes with her charge. Marian looked at the pregnant
girl compassionately. Meta was ill at ease; to every question
that was put to her she made an incoherent reply. She could
stay with her, said Marian, but she would have to work, for
there was no other way for the two to live. The girl referred to
the fact that she had already worked out for four years, and that
no one had ever accused her of lack of industry or willingness.
Thereupon Marian told her she would have to be very quiet,
that the people in the neighbourhood were very curious, and that
if she ever gave them her family history she would have to leave.</p>

<p>This attended to, Eleanore went on her way. She refused
quite emphatically to stay for dinner. Marian thought that she
was in a hurry to catch the next coach, and accompanied her across
the square. They promised to write to each other; before
Eleanore got into the rickety old coach, Marian kissed her on the
cheek.</p>

<p>She watched the coach until it had passed out through the city
gate. A drunken man poked her in the ribs, the blacksmith called
to her as she passed by, the doctor&#8217;s wife leaned out of the window
and asked her who the cityfied lady was. Marian paid not the
slightest attention to any of them; she went quietly and slowly
back to her house.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p><h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Thus it came about that five weeks later a daughter of Daniel
Nothafft saw the light of the world under Marian&#8217;s roof.</p>

<p>As soon as the child was born, Marian took a great liking to it,
despite the fact that she had thought of it before its birth only
with aversion. It was a fine little creature: its little legs and arms
were delicately formed, its head was small, there was something
peculiarly human about its first cries and laughter, and it showed
quite distinctly that there was something noble in its character.</p>

<p>The people of Eschenbach were astonished. &#8220;Where did the
child come from?&#8221; they asked. &#8220;Who is its mother? Who is its
father?&#8221; The records in the office of the registrar of births showed
that Meta Steinh&auml;ger was the mother of the illegitimate child,
Eva Steinh&auml;ger, and that its father was unknown.</p>

<p>It was to be presumed, however, that widow Nothafft knew the
details. The old women, and the young ones too, came on this
account more frequently now than ever to her shop. They wanted
to know how the little thing was getting along, whether its milk
agreed with it, whether it had begun to teethe, whether it would
speak German or some foreign tongue, and so on.</p>

<p>In order to quiet them, Marian told them that Meta was a poor
relative and that she was bringing up the child at her own expense.
It was not difficult to make this story seem plausible, for Meta had
very little to do with her daughter. Shortly after her confinement,
she got a job with a baker over in Dinkelsb&uuml;hl, and never
visited Eva more than once a month. She cared very little for the
child. A young fellow in the bakery had fallen in love with
Meta, and wanted to marry her and move to America.</p>

<p>At Christmas they were married, and left the country at once.
Marian was glad of it: the child now belonged entirely to her.</p>

<p>Though the people soon became accustomed to the existence of
their diminutive fellow-townswoman, Eva was and remained the
mysterious child of Eschenbach.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>The opera company made its rounds through the small cities that
lie between the Danube and the Main, the Saale and the Neckar&mdash;and
there are many of them,&mdash;its stay in any one place depending
naturally on the interest shown by the public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;The province is the enchanted Sleeping Beauty,&#8221; said the
impresario D&ouml;rmaul to Wurzelmann and Daniel, &#8220;the province is
still asleep, and you must rouse it from its slumbers by pressing
the kiss of the Muse on its forehead.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the impresario was unwilling to open his pockets. The
princes who were to release Sleeping Beauty did not have sufficient
means to make a presentable appearance, while their retinue was
seedy-looking indeed.</p>

<p>The tenor had long since passed the zenith of his career.
His massive paunch placed deadening strictures on his credentials
as the impersonator of heroes. The buffo was an inveterate toper
who had often been placed behind bars by the police for his
nocturnal excesses. The barytone had a big lawsuit on his hands
about an estate; his lawyers were two stars of obscurity from a small
village; and at times he became so vexed at the cuts of his opponents
that he lost his voice. The soprano was incessantly quarrelling with
her colleagues, and the alto was an intriguing vixen quite without
talent. In addition to these there were a dozen or so super-numeraries
and under-studies, who were bored, who played practical
jokes on each other, drew starvation wages, and had never learned
anything.</p>

<p>The musicians were also a sorry lot. It was not rare that one or
the other of them had pawned his instrument. Once a performance
had to be postponed because the violinists had stayed over
their time at a village dance where they were playing in order to
add to their paltry income. The inspector, who was scene-shifter,
promoter, ticket seller, and publicity agent all in one, and who
was not equal to any of these positions, took French leave in the
second year and ran off with one of the chorus girls, taking the
box-office receipts for the evening with him.</p>

<p>One time the costumes were sent to the wrong address, with the
result that Boieldieu&#8217;s &#8220;La Dame Blanche&#8221; had to be played in
woollen frocks, patched velvet skirts, filthy cotton blouses, and
French wadding.</p>

<p>Another time the mob in &#8220;Martha&#8221; consisted of a distempered
woman, a waiter brought in at the last minute from a herring restaurant,
and the door-keeper of an orphanage: the chorus had gone
on a strike because their salaries had been held up.</p>

<p>In Karlstadt the final act of the &#8220;Merry Wives of Windsor&#8221;
could not be played, because during the intermission Falstaff and
Mrs. Quickly had got into a fight, and the lady had scratched a
huge piece of skin from the singer&#8217;s nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p><p>If these musical strollers, as acting-director Wurzelmann called
the company, nevertheless made some money, it was due to the
superhuman efforts of Daniel. Wurzelmann was always mixed up
in some kind of love affair, introduced in time a ruinous system of
favouritism, and became lazier and lazier as the weeks passed by.</p>

<p>Daniel had to pull the singers out of their beds to get them to
go to rehearsals; Daniel had to help out with the singing when
the chorus was too weak; Daniel had to distribute the r&ocirc;les, tame
down refractory women, and make brainless dilettants subordinate
their noisy opinions to the demands of a work which he himself
generally detested. He had to drill beginners, abbreviate scores,
transpose voices, and produce effects with lamentably inadequate
material. And from morning to night he had to wage war eternal
against libellous action, inattention, and inability.</p>

<p>Nobody loved him for this; they merely feared him. They
swore they would take vengeance on him, but they knuckled under
whenever they seemed to have a chance. He had a habit of treating
them with crushing coldness, he could make them look like criminals.
He had a look of icy contempt that made them clench their
fists when his eye fell on them. But they bowed before a power
which seemed uncanny to them, though it consisted in nothing more
than the fact that he did his duty while they did not.</p>

<p>At the close of each quarter, the impresario D&ouml;rmaul appeared
on the scene to take invoice in person. His presence was invariably
celebrated by a gala performance of &#8220;Fra Diavolo,&#8221; or &#8220;The
Daughter of the Regiment,&#8221; or &#8220;Frou Frou.&#8221; On these occasions
the buffo did not get drunk, the barytone rested from the torments
of his lawsuit, the alto had a charming smile for the sympathetic
house, the soprano was as peaceful as a mine immediately after an
explosion. Not one of the chorus stayed too long in the caf&eacute;;
and since Wurzelmann directed, and the orchestra did not have to
feel the burning, basilisk eye of Kapellmeister Nothafft resting
on it and floating over it, it played with more precision and
produced a more pleasing feast for the ears than ordinarily.</p>

<p>D&ouml;rmaul was not stingy with his praise. &#8220;Bravo Wurzelmann,&#8221;
he cried, &#8220;one more short year of hard work, and I&#8217;ll get you a
position in the Royal Opera House.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothafft will likewise rise to fame and office,&#8221; he said, &#8220;although
I was so stupid as to publish his music, and now all this
waste paper is lying in my shop like a pound of brick cheese in a
sick stomach.&#8221;</p>

<p>The impresario D&ouml;rmaul wore black and white striped trousers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>of imported cut, a vest that looked like a bit of tapestry made of
pressed leather, a massive gold watch-chain from which dangled
countless fobs, a blood red tie with a diamond as big as the
Koh-i-noor and as false as an April sun, and a grey silk tile hat
which he lifted only when in the presence of privy councillors,
generals, and police presidents.</p>

<p>To a man of this kind Daniel had the boldness to remark:
&#8220;Had you eaten cheese you would at least have digested it. Your
crowded shops are after all more desirable in my estimation than
many a head which would remain empty even if some one stuffed
the whole of the &#8216;Passion of St. Matthew&#8217; into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>D&ouml;rmaul decided to laugh. &#8220;Oho, my good fellow,&#8221; he said,
and pushed his tile hat on to the back of his head, &#8220;you are getting
all puffed up. Look out that you don&#8217;t burst. You remember
the story of H&auml;nschen: He was awfully proud of his porridge
while sitting behind the stove; but when he went out on to the
street, he fell into the puddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little slave tittered. Daniel had known for a long time
that Wurzelmann was working against him. Quite innocently, to
be sure, for half souls can admire and betray at the same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Envy is my only virtue,&#8221; said Wurzelmann quite openly, &#8220;I
am a genius at envying.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel was not equal to such cynicism. He was stupefied by
Wurzelmann&#8217;s remark, but he did not break with the little slave;
he continued to use him. He was the only individual with whom
he could speak of himself and his work. And though he was
overburdened, owing to his present position, he nevertheless managed
to steal a few hours every day for his own work. And the
pressure from all sides fanned the flame within him.</p>

<p>It was then that he staked out his field in order to be master
in his own realm; he turned to the song; he chose the clear,
restrained forms of chamber music; he studied with unwavering
industry the old masters; he deduced from their works the right
rules of composition; and he set these up before him like a dam
against arbitrariness and &aelig;sthetic demoralisation.</p>

<p>He was not unmindful of the fact that by so doing he was
cutting himself off from association with men, and renouncing,
probably forever, the satisfaction that comes from monetary reward
and outward success. He knew, too, that he was not making his
life easier by adopting this course, nor was he gaining the popular
favour of the emotionalists.</p>

<p>When he would sit in a caf&eacute; late at night and show Wurzelmann
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>one score after another, sing a few bars in order to bring out the
quality of a song, improvise an accompaniment, praise a melody,
or explain the peculiarity of a certain rhythm, he surprised the
little slave, and drove him into an attitude of self-defence. All
this was fundamentally new to Wurzelmann. If Daniel proved
that the new was not new after all, that the trouble lay in the
fact that the deranged and shattered souls of the present century
had lost the power to assimilate unbroken lines in their complete
purity, Wurzelmann at once became an advocate of modern freedom,
insisting that each individual should be allowed to do all
that his innate talent enabled him to vindicate.</p>

<p>Daniel remained unconvinced. Was not the whole of life, the
rich contents of human existence, to be found in the beautiful
vessel that had been proved long ago? Could any one say that he
was displaying a spirit of greediness in his love for the classical?
And were joy and sorrow, however intense, less perceptible when
expressed through a concise, well ordered medium? &#8220;What a
distorted view a man takes when he becomes so narrow-minded,&#8221;
thought Daniel. &#8220;His ambition makes it impossible for him to
feel; his very wit militates against clear thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus they went from town to town, month after month, year
after year. The company had in time its traditions, its <i>chronique
scandaleuse</i>, its oft-tested drawing cards, its regular patrons, its
favourite stands, and its stands that it avoided if humanly possible.</p>

<p>The local paper greeted them editorially; the children stood on
the sidewalks to gape their fill at the ladies from the theatre; the
retired major bought a reserved seat for the first performance; the
barber offered his services; and the faculty of the Latin School
held a special meeting to decide whether they should permit their
pupils to go to the opera or not. The Young Men&#8217;s Christian
Association voiced its protest against the nude shoulders of the
<i>artistes</i>; the members of the Casino turned up their noses at the
achievements of the company; the police insisted that the booth
or hotel lobby in which they performed should be fireproof; the
wife of the mining engineer fell in love with the barytone, and
her husband hired a number of hoodlums to take their places in
the gallery and hoot and hiss when the time came. And those
who nag under any circumstances requested more cheerfulness.
They found the &#8220;Czar and Zimmermann&#8221; too dull, the &#8220;Muette
de Portici&#8221; too hackneyed. They insisted on &#8220;Madame Angot&#8221;
and &#8220;Orpheus in the Under World.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was always something wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p><p>Daniel shuddered at the mere presence of these people; he was
repelled by their occupations, their amusements, and the cadavers
of their ideals. He did not like the way they laughed; nor could
he stand their dismal feelings. He despised the houses out of
which they crept, the detectives at their windows, their butcher
shops and hotels, their newspapers, their Sundays and their work
days. The world was pressing hard upon him. He had to look
these people straight in the face, and they compelled him to haggle
with them for money, words, feelings, and ideas.</p>

<p>He learned in time, however, to see other things: the forests on
the banks of the Main; the great meadows in the hills of Franconia;
the melancholy plains of Central Germany; the richly
variegated slopes of the Jura Mountains; the old cities with their
walls and cathedrals, their gloomy alleys and deserted castles. In
time he came to see people in a different and easier light. He
saw the young and the old, the fair and the homely, the cheerful
and the sad, the poor&mdash;and the rich so far away and peaceful.
They gave him, without discrimination, of their wealth and their
poverty. They laid their youth and their old age, their beauty
and their ugliness, their joys and their sorrows, at his feet.</p>

<p>And the country gave him the forests and the fields, the brooks
and the rivers, the clouds and the birds, and everything that is
under the earth.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>It was winter. The company came to Ansbach, where they were
to play in the former Margrave Theatre. &#8220;Freisch&uuml;tz&#8221; was to be
given, and Daniel had held a number of special rehearsals.</p>

<p>But a violent snow storm broke out on the day of the performance;
scarcely two dozen people attended.</p>

<p>How differently the violins sounded in this auditorium! The
voices were, as it seemed, automatically well balanced; there was
in them an element of calm and assurance. The orchestra?
Daniel had so charmed it that it obeyed him as if it were a single
instrument. At the close of the last act, an old, grey-haired man
stepped up to Daniel, smiled, took him by the hand, and thanked
him. It was Spindler.</p>

<p>Daniel went home with him; they talked about the past, the
future, men and music. They could not stop talking; nor could
the snow stop falling. This did not disturb them. They met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>again on the following day; but at the end of the week Spindler
was taken ill, and had to go to bed.</p>

<p>As Daniel entered the residence of his old friend one morning,
he learned that he had died suddenly the night before. It had
been a peaceful death.</p>

<p>On the third day, Daniel followed the funeral procession to the
cemetery. When he left the cemetery&mdash;there were but few people
at the funeral&mdash;he went out into the snow-covered fields, and spent
the remainder of the day walking around.</p>

<p>That same night he sat down in his wretched quarters, and
began his composition of Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Harzreise im Winter.&#8221; It
was one of the profoundest and rarest of works ever created by a
musician, but it was destined, like the most of Daniel&#8217;s compositions,
not to be preserved to posterity. This was due to a tragic
circumstance.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>In the spring of 1886, the company went north to Hesse, then
to Thuringia, gave performances in a few of the towns in the
Spessart region and along the Rhoen, the box receipts growing
smaller and smaller all the while. D&ouml;rmaul had not been seen
since the previous autumn; the salaries had not been paid for some
time. Wurzelmann prophesied a speedy and fatal end of the
enterprise.</p>

<p>An engagement of unusual length had been planned for the
town of Ochsenfurt. The company placed its last hopes on the
series, although it was already June and very warm. The thick,
muggy air of the gloomy hall in which they were to play left
even the enthusiasts without much desire to brighten up the
monotony of provincial life by the enjoyment of grand opera.</p>

<p>They drew smaller houses from day to day. Finally there was
no more money in the till; they did not even have enough to move
to the next town. To make matters worse, the tenor was taken
down with typhus, and the other singers refused to sing until they
had been paid. Daniel wrote to D&ouml;rmaul, but received no reply.
Wurzelmann, instead of helping, fanned the easily inflamed minds
of the company into a fire of noise, malevolence, and hostility.
They demanded that Daniel give them what was due them,
besieged him in his hotel, and finally brought matters to such a
pitch that the whole town was busied with their difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p><p>One afternoon, a stately gentleman between fifty-five and fifty-six
years old entered Daniel&#8217;s room, and introduced himself as
Sylvester von Erfft, the owner of an estate.</p>

<p>His mission was as follows: Every year, at this season, the
Chancellor of the German Empire was taking the cure at the
nearby Kissingen Baths. Herr von Erfft had made his acquaintance,
and the Prince, an enthusiastic landowner, had expressed
the desire to visit Herr von Erfft&#8217;s estate, the management of
which was widely known as excellent in every way. In order to
celebrate the coming of the distinguished guest with befitting
dignity, it had been decided not to have any tawdry fireworks or
cheap shouting, but to give a special performance of the &#8220;Marriage
of Figaro&#8221; in a rococo pavilion that belonged to the Erfft estate.</p>

<p>&#8220;This idea comes from my wife,&#8221; said Herr von Erfft. &#8220;Some
ladies and gentlemen of noble birth who belong to our circle
will sing the various parts, and my daughter Sylvia, who studied
for two years in Milan with Gallifati, will take the part of the
page. The only thing we lack is a trained orchestra. For this
reason I have come to you, Herr Kapellmeister, to see if you could
not bring your orchestra over and play for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel, though pleased with the kindly disposition of Herr von
Erfft, could not make him any definite promise, for he felt bound
to the helpless, if not hopeless, opera company now in his care.
Herr von Erfft inquired more closely into the grounds of his doubt
as to his ability to have his orchestra undertake the special engagement,
and then asked him whether he would accept his help.
&#8220;Gladly,&#8221; replied Daniel, &#8220;but such help as you can offer us will
hardly be of any avail. Our chief is a hardened sinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herr von Erfft went with Daniel to the mayor; a half-hour
later an official dispatch was on its way to the impresario D&ouml;rmaul.
It was couched in language that was sufficient to inspire any citizen
with respect, referred to the desperate plight in which the company
then found itself, and demanded in a quite imperious tone
that something be done at once.</p>

<p>D&ouml;rmaul was frightened; he sent the necessary money by return
wire. In another telegram to Wurzelmann he declared the company
dissolved; most of the contracts had expired, and those members
of the company who put in claims were satisfied in one way
or another.</p>

<p>Daniel was free. Wurzelmann said to him on taking leave:
&#8220;Nothafft, you will never amount to anything. I have been disappointed
in you. You have far too much conscience. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>cannot make children out of morality, much less music. The
swamp is quaggy, the summit rocky. Commit some act of genuine
swinishness, so that you may put a little ginger into your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel laid his hand on his shoulder, looked at him with his
cold eyes, and said: &#8220;Judas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Judas so far as I am concerned,&#8221; said Wurzelmann.
&#8220;I was not born to be nailed to the cross; I am much more for the
feasts with the Pharisees.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had got a position as critic on the <i>Ph&#339;nix</i>, one of the
best known musical magazines.</p>

<p>Daniel found the members of the orchestra only too glad to
take the excursion over to Herr von Erfft&#8217;s. They were put up
in a hotel; Daniel himself lived in the castle. The rehearsals
were held with zeal and seriousness. Though the name of the
Chancellor was still darkened by the clouds of political life, by the
enmity of his opponents, by pettiness and misunderstanding, all
these young people felt the power of the great Immortal, and
were delighted with the idea of meaning something to him, even
in the guise of an imaginary world and for only a fleeting hour
or two. Agatha von Erfft, the wife of Herr von Erfft, was
indefatigable in preparing the costumes, surmounting technical
difficulties, and entertaining her guests. The twenty-four-year-old
Sylvia had inherited neither the strength of her mother nor the
amiability of her father: she was delicate and reserved. Nevertheless,
she managed to put a great deal of winsomeness and roguishness
into the r&ocirc;le of the cherub. Even her parents were surprised
at the unexpected wealth of her natural ability. Moreover, her
voice was velvety and well trained. Accustomed as he had been
for years to the mediocre accomplishments of sore throats, Daniel
nodded approval when she sang.</p>

<p>The other members of the improvised company he handled
with no greater indulgence than he had shown the singers of the
D&ouml;rmaul troupe. They had to put up with his gruffness and
snappishness, and to do it without a murmur. Herr von Erfft
attended the rehearsals regularly, observing Daniel at all times
with quiet admiration. If Daniel spoke to any one with such seeming
harshness that the case was taken up with Herr von Erfft, the
latter said: &#8220;Let the man have his way; he knows his business;
there are not many like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sylvia was the only one he treated with consideration. As soon
as Herr von Erfft mentioned her name, Daniel listened; and as
soon as he had seen her, he knew that he had seen her before. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>was the time he was on his journey; he was standing out at the
entrance to the park; some one called to her. It seemed strange
to him that he should remember this. Now he was with her, and
yet he was just as much of a stranger to her as ever.</p>

<p>But the thing that drew him to the beautiful girl had nothing
to do with this chance incident; nor was there the slightest trace
of sensuousness in his feelings. It was all a sort of dream-like sympathy,
similar to the quest of memory in search of a forgotten
happiness. It was a vaguer and more plaguing sensation than the
one that bound him so inviolably to Gertrude; it was more sorrow
than joy, more unrest than consciousness.</p>

<p>This forgotten happiness slumbered deep down in his soul; it
had been washed away by the waves of life. It was not Sylvia herself;
it was perhaps a movement of her hand: where had he known
this same movement before? It was the way she tossed her head
back; it was her proud look, the blue of her eyes&mdash;but where had
he seen all this before?</p>

<p>Forgotten, forgotten....</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>Just as everything was in full swing, just as they had decorated
the buildings and arranged the Herrenhaus, the news came of the
death of King Ludwig of Bavaria. The newspapers bore a broad
black margin, and were crowded with details concerning the tragedy
at the Starnbergersee. The entire country, including the family
of Herr von Erfft, mourned the loss of the art-loving monarch
genuinely and for a long while.</p>

<p>Of an operatic performance there could be no thought. The
Chancellor cancelled his engagement, and the young men who
had assembled for the rehearsals went quietly home. Herr von
Erfft gave Daniel a considerable purse with which he might recompense
his musicians for their trouble, and, not wishing to treat
Daniel himself as though he were an ordinary mechanic, he invited
him to spend a few more days on his estate.</p>

<p>Daniel did not decline; he had not in truth given one minute&#8217;s
thought to where he would go when he left.</p>

<p>After he distributed the present from Herr von Erfft among
the musicians and discharged them, he took a long walk in the
woods. He ate a frugal meal in a village restaurant, and then
sauntered around until evening. When he returned, he found his
hosts sitting at the table. He neglected to beg their pardon; Frau
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>Agatha looked at her husband and smiled, and told the maids to
bring in something for the Herr Kapellmeister. Sylvia had a
book in her hand and was reading.</p>

<p>Daniel was a trifle ill at ease; he merely took a bite here and
there. When Frau von Erfft left the table, walked over to the
window, and looked out into the cloudy sky, Daniel got up, went
into the adjoining room, and sat down at the piano.</p>

<p>He began to play Schubert&#8217;s &#8220;Song to Sylvia.&#8221; Having finished
the impetuous, heart-felt song, he struck up a variation, then a
second, a third, and a fourth. The first was melancholy, the second
triumphant, the third meditative, the fourth dreamy. Each
was a hymn to forgotten joy.</p>

<p>Herr von Erfft and Agatha were standing in the open door.
Sylvia had sat down close beside him on a tabourette; there was a
pleasing, far-away look in her eyes, riveted though they were to
the floor.</p>

<p>He suddenly stopped, as if to avoid both thanks and applause.
Sylvester von Erfft took a seat opposite him, and asked him in a
most kindly tone whether he had any definite plans for the immediate
future.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going back to Nuremberg and get married,&#8221; said Daniel.
&#8220;My fianc&eacute;e has been waiting for me for a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herr von Erfft asked him whether he was not afraid of premature
marriage bonds. Daniel replied rather curtly that he
needed some one to stand between him and the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need some one to act as a sort of buffer,&#8221; said Frau Agatha
sarcastically. Daniel looked at her angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buffer? No, but a guardian angel if such a creature can shield
me from rebuffs,&#8221; said Daniel, even more brusquely than he had
spoken the first time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you wish to settle down and live in Nuremberg, a city
of such one-sided commercial interests?&#8221; continued Herr von Erfft,
with an almost solicitous caution. &#8220;Would you not have a much
better opportunity as a composer in one of the great cities?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible to separate the daughter from her father,&#8221;
replied Daniel with unusual candour. &#8220;It is impossible. Nor is
it possible to get the old man to tear himself away from his former
associations. He was born and reared there. And I do not wish
to live alone any longer. Everybody needs a companion; even
the miner digs with a better heart, when he knows that up on the
earth above his wife is preparing the soup. I must say, however,
that I am not so much taken up with the soup phase of married
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>life: it is the dear little soul that will belong to me that interests
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned around, and struck a minor chord.</p>

<p>&#8220;And even if everything were different, your great cities would
not attract me,&#8221; he began again, wrinkling his face in a most bizarre
way. &#8220;What would I get out of them? Companions? I have
had enough of them. Music I can study at home. I can summon
the masters of all ages to my study. Fame and riches will find
their way to me, if they wish to. The dawn is missed only by
those who are too indolent to get up, and real music is heard
by all except the deaf. God attends to everything else; man has
nothing to do with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He struck another chord, this time in a major key.</p>

<p>Herr von Erfft and his wife looked at him with evident joy and
sympathy. Sylvia whispered something to her mother, who then
said to Daniel: &#8220;I have a sister living in Nuremberg, Baroness
Clotilde von Auffenberg. From the time she was a mere child
she was an ardent lover of good music. If I give you a letter of
introduction to her, I am quite sure she will welcome you with
open arms. She is unfortunately not in the best of health, and a
heavy fate is just now hanging over her; but she has a warm heart,
and her affections are trustworthy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel looked down at the floor. He thought of Gertrude and
his future life with her, and murmured a few words of gratitude.
Frau von Erfft went at once to her desk, and wrote a detailed
letter to her sister. When she had finished it, she gave it to
Daniel with a good-natured smile.</p>

<p>The next morning he left the castle with the feeling of regret
that one experiences on leaving the dwelling place of peace and
separating from noble friends.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>The streets of Nuremberg were hung with black banners. It was
raining. Daniel took a cheap room in The Bear.</p>

<p>It had already grown dark when he started to Jordan&#8217;s. He
met Benno at the front door. He did not recognise the foppishly-dressed
young man, and was on the point of passing by without
speaking to him; but Benno stopped, and laughed out loud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew, the Herr Kapellmeister!&#8221; he cried, and his pale face,
already showing the signs of dissipation, took on a scornful expression.
&#8220;Be careful, my friend, or Gertrude will swoon.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p><p>Daniel asked if they were all well. Benno replied that there
was no lack of good health, though some of the family were a
little short of change. Then he laughed again. He spoke of his
father, said the old gentleman was not getting along very well,
that he was having quite a little trouble to get anything to do, but
then what could be expected with a man of his age, and the competition
and the hard times! Daniel asked if Eleanore was at
home. No, she was not at home: she had gone on a visit with
Frau R&uuml;bsam over to Pommersfelden, and planned to stay there
for a few weeks. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll have to be hurrying along,&#8221; said
Benno, &#8220;my fraternity brothers are waiting for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious! Do you have fraternity brothers too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course! They are the spice of my life! We have a holiday
to-day: The King&#8217;s funeral. Well, God bless you, Herr
Kapellmeister, I must be going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel went up and rang the bell; Gertrude came to the door.
It was dark; each could see only the outline of the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you, Daniel!&#8221; she whispered, happy as happy could be.
She came up to him, and laid her face on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Daniel was surprised at the regularity of his pulse. Yesterday
the mere thought of this meeting took his breath. Now he held
Gertrude in his arms, and was amazed to find that he was perfectly
calm and composed.</p>

<p>In the room he led her over to the lamp, and looked at her for a
long while, fixedly and seriously. She grew pale at the sight of
him: he was so strange and so terrible.</p>

<p>Then he took her by the hand, led her over to the sofa, sat
down beside her, and told her of his plans. Her wishes and his
tallied exactly. He wanted to get married within four weeks.
Very well; she would get married.</p>

<p>He found her the same unqualifiedly submissive girl. In her
eyes there was an expression of fatal docility; it terrified him.
There was no cowardly doubt in her soul; her cool hand lay in
his and did not twitch. With her hand her whole soul, her whole
life, lay in his hand. He wanted to raise some doubt in her
mind: he spoke in a down-hearted tone of his future prospects; he
said that there was very little hope of his ever winning recognition
from the world for his compositions.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the good of recognition?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;They can take
nothing from you, and what they give you is clear gain.&#8221;</p>

<p>He became silent. The feeling of her worth to him swept
like a fiery meteor through the heaven of his existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p><p>The statement that they were going to remain in Nuremberg
made her happy, particularly because of her father. She said
there was a small apartment for rent on &AElig;gydius Place, three
rooms, a very quiet neighbourhood. They went over to the window;
Gertrude showed him the house. It was close to the church,
right where the Place makes a turn.</p>

<p>Jordan came in, and welcomed Daniel with a long handshake.
His hair had become greyer, he walked with more of a stoop, and
his clothes showed traces of neglect.</p>

<p>When he heard what Daniel and Gertrude were planning to
do, he shook his head: &#8220;It is a bad year, children. Why are you
in such a hurry? Both of you are still young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we were older, we would have less courage,&#8221; replied Daniel.</p>

<p>Jordan took a seat, and buried his face in his hands. In course
of time he looked up, and said that three years ago he had only
eight thousand marks in the bank; that hard times had forced
him to draw on this sum to keep the house going; and that to-day
there was hardly a third of it left. Two thousand marks was all
he could give Gertrude as a dowry; with that they would have to
be satisfied, and get along as well as they could.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need any more,&#8221; said Daniel; &#8220;as a matter of fact
I did not expect that much. Now I haven&#8217;t a care in the world;
I am ready for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>A bat flew in at the open window, and then quietly flew out
again. It had stopped raining. You could still hear the water
trickling and splashing down the leaders and in the pipes. There
was something heavy, portentous, in the air of this June evening.</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>At first Daniel had received small bits of news from England
about Benda, but for a year and a half he had not heard a word.
When Eleanore returned from Pommersfelden in July, she told
him that she had received a letter from Benda in April, and that
she had sent him this letter when he was at Naumburg. Daniel,
however, had never received it, and the investigations which he
made proved fruitless.</p>

<p>Benda&#8217;s mother was not in the city; she was living with relatives
in Worms, but had kept her apartment at Herr Carovius&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Frau von Auffenberg was at Bad Ems, and did not plan to
return until September. Daniel looked up old friends, and
rebound the ties of former days. He also succeeded in getting a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>number of students to tutor, an occupation that netted him a little
spending money.</p>

<p>He had to attend to a great deal of business for which he was
quite unfit. He had imagined that he could get married just as
he might go to a shop and buy something: he would not make any
noise, nor would it take much time. He had a hundred moods,
a hundred objections, a hundred grimaces. The apartment on
&AElig;gydius Place was already rented. It embittered him to think
that in order to live with a person you loved, you had to have
tables, beds, chairs, cupboards, lamps, glasses, plates, garbage cans,
water pails, window cushions, and a thousand and one other foolish
objects.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of talk in the city about the marriage.
The people said they did not know what Jordan could be thinking
of. They were convinced that he was in desperate financial straits
if he would marry his daughter to an impecunious musician.</p>

<p>Daniel found everything hard: every day was his Day of Judgment.
A melody was gnawing at his heart, trying to take on a
pure and finished form. Freedom sounded in his ears with voices
from above; his quiet fianc&eacute;e begged for comradeship. The task
to which he had dedicated himself demanded loneliness; then his
blood carried him along and away, and he became like wax,
but wild.</p>

<p>He would rush to Jordan&#8217;s house, enter the living room, his hair
all dishevelled, sit down where the two sisters were working on
Gertrude&#8217;s trousseau, and never utter a syllable until Gertrude
would come up to him and lay her hand on his forehead. He
thrust her back, but she smiled gently. At times, though none too
frequently, he would take her by the arms and pull her down to
him. When he did this, Eleanore would smile with marked
demureness, as if it were not right for her to see two people in
love.</p>

<p>There was a second-hand baby grand piano in Jordan&#8217;s living
room. Daniel played on it in the evening, and the sisters listened.
Gertrude was like a woman wrapt in peaceful slumber, her every
wish having been fulfilled, with kindly spirits watching over her.
Eleanore, however, was wide awake; she was awake and meditating.</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>The day of the wedding arrived. At half past nine in the
morning, Daniel appeared in Jordan&#8217;s house. He wore an afternoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>suit and a high hat! He was vexed, and villanous to behold,
a picture of misery.</p>

<p>Benno, the man of the world, was forced to leave the room.
No sooner was he outside than he laughed so heartily that he fell
into a clothes basket. He did not approve of this marriage; he
was ashamed to tell his friends about it.</p>

<p>Gertrude wore a plain street dress and a little virgin bonnet,
then prescribed by fashion. She sat by the table, and gazed into
space with wide-opened eyes.</p>

<p>Eleanore came into the room with a wreath of myrtle. &#8220;You
must put this on, Gertrude,&#8221; she said, &#8220;just to please us; just to
make us feel that you are a real bride. Otherwise you look too
sober, too much as though you two were going to the recorder&#8217;s
office on profane business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get that wreath?&#8221; asked Jordan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found it in an old chest; it is mother&#8217;s bridal wreath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really? Mother&#8217;s bridal wreath?&#8221; murmured Jordan, as he
looked at the faded myrtle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it on, Gertrude,&#8221; Eleanore again requested, but Gertrude
looked first at Daniel, and then laid it to one side.</p>

<p>Eleanore went up to the mirror, and put it on her own head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that, child,&#8221; said Jordan with a melancholy smile.
&#8220;Superstitious people say that you will remain an old maid forever,
if you wear the wreath of another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will remain an old maid, and gladly so,&#8221; said Eleanore.</p>

<p>She turned away from the mirror, and looked at Daniel half
unconscious of what she was doing. The blond of her eyelashes
had turned almost grey, the red of her lips had been dotted with
little spots from her smiling, and her neck was like something
liquid and disembodied.</p>

<p>Daniel saw all this. He looked at the Undine-like figure of
the girl. It seemed to him that he had not seen her since the day
of his return, that he had not noticed that she had become more
mature, more beautiful, and more lovely. All of a sudden he felt
as if he were going to swoon. It went through him like a flash:
Here, here was what he had forgotten; here was the countenance,
the eye, the figure, the movement that had stood before him, and
he, fool, unspeakable fool, had been struck by blindness.</p>

<p>Gertrude had a fearful suspicion of the experience he was going
through. She arose, and looked at Daniel in horror. He hastened
up to her as if he were fleeing, and seized her hands. Eleanore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>believing she had aroused Daniel&#8217;s displeasure by some word or
gesture, snatched the myrtle wreath from her hair.</p>

<p>Jordan had paid no attention to these incidents. Bringing at
last his restless pacing back and forth to an end, he took out his
watch, looked at it, and said it was time they were going. Eleanore,
who had displayed a most curious disposition the whole morning,
asked them to wait a minute. Before they could find out why
she wished them to wait, the door bell rang, and she ran out.</p>

<p>She returned with a radiant expression on her face; Marian
Nothafft followed her. Marian composed herself only with
extreme difficulty. Her eyes roamed about over the circle of
people before her, partly as if she were frightened, partly as if
she were looking for some one.</p>

<p>Mother and son stood face to face in absolute silence. That
was the work of Eleanore.</p>

<p>Marian said she was living with her sister Theresa; that she
had arrived the day before; and that she wished to return this
evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad, Mother, that you could come,&#8221; said Daniel with a
stifled voice.</p>

<p>Marian laid her hand on his head; she then went up to Gertrude,
and did the same.</p>

<p>After the wedding, Jordan gave a luncheon for his children.
In the afternoon they all started off in two hired coaches. Daniel
had never seen his mother so cheerful; but it was useless to ask
her to prolong her visit. While this was being discussed, she and
Eleanore exchanged knowing glances.</p>

<p>As evening drew on, Daniel and Gertrude betook themselves to
their home.</p>


<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>It is night. The antiquated old square is deserted. The bell
in the church tower has struck eleven; the lights in the windows
die out, slowly, one by one.</p>

<p>The figure of a woman is seen coming up the alley. She is
spying anxiously about, before her and behind her. Finally she
stops before the little house in which Daniel and Gertrude live.
Is it a living creature? Is it not rather an uncanny gnome? The
garments hang loose about the unshapely body; a crumpled straw
hat covers the mad-looking face; the shoulders are raised; the fists
are clenched; the eyes are glassy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p><p>Suddenly there is a scream. The woman hastens over toward
the church, falls on her knees, and sinks her teeth with frenzied
madness into the wooden pickets of the fence. After some time
she rises, stares up once more at the windows with distorted lips,
and then moves away with slow, dragging steps.</p>

<p>It was Philippina Schimmelweis. She kept going about the
streets in this fashion until break of day.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span><a name="DANIEL_AND_GERTRUDE" id="DANIEL_AND_GERTRUDE"></a>DANIEL AND GERTRUDE</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> Reichstag had voted to extend the period during which the
Socialist law would be in effect; the passing of a new army bill
was also to be expected. These two measures had provoked tumultuous
discord in many parts of the country.</p>

<p>The Social Democrats were planning a parade through the main
streets of the city in October, but the police had already forbidden
their demonstration. The evening the edict was issued the regiments
stood at alert in the barracks; feeling ran high throughout
the entire city. In W&ouml;hrd and Plobenhof there had been a number
of riots; in the narrow streets of the central zone thousands of
workmen had stormed the Rathaus.</p>

<p>Every now and then there would come a long, shrill whistle
from the silent mass, followed at once by the heavy rolling of
drums at the guard house.</p>

<p>Among those who came down from the direction of Koenig
Street was the workman Wachsmuth. In the vicinity of the
Schimmelweis shop he delivered an excited harangue against the
former member of the party; his words fell on fruitful soil. A
locksmith&#8217;s apprentice who had lost some money through the Prudentia
violently defamed the character of the bookseller.</p>

<p>The mob gathered before the lighted shop window. Wachsmuth
stood by the door, and demanded that the traitor be suspended
from a lamp post before this day&#8217;s sun had set. A stone flew
through the air over their heads, and crashed through the window;
pieces of glass flew in all directions. Thereupon a dozen fellows
rushed into the shop, exclaiming, &#8220;Where is the dirty dog? Let
us get at the blood-sucker!&#8221; They wanted to teach him a lesson
he would never forget.</p>

<p>Before Theresa could open her mouth, scraps of books and
newspapers were flying in every direction, and pamphlets were
being trampled under foot. A forest of arms were reaching out
for the shelves, and bundles of books were falling to the floor,
like stacks of cards piled up by a child and blown over by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>wind. Zwanziger had taken refuge at the top of the ladder; he
was howling. Theresa stood by the till looking like the ghost of
ages. Philippina came in through the back door, and eyed what
was going on without one visible trace of surprise or discomfort;
she merely smiled. Just then the policeman&#8217;s whistle blew; in
less time than it takes to draw one breath, the rebellious insurgents
were beating a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>When Theresa regained consciousness, the shop was empty; and
the street in front of the shop was as deserted as it ordinarily is
at midnight. After some time, the chief of police came up; he
was followed by a crowd of curious people, who stood around and
gaped at the scene of devastation.</p>

<p>Jason Philip, seeing what was coming, had left the shop betimes
and hidden in his house. He had even locked the front door and
was sunk down on a chair, his teeth clappering with vigour and
regularity.</p>

<p>He returned at last to the shop, and with heart-rending dignity
faced the dispenser of justice, who by this time had put in his
appearance. He said: &#8220;And this is what I get from people for
whom I have sacrificed my money and my blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>In giving his testimony as an eyewitness, Zwanziger displayed
boastful hardiness in his narration of details. Philippina looked
at him with venomous contempt from under the imbecile locks
that hung down over her forehead, and murmured: &#8220;You disgusting
coward!&#8221;</p>

<p>When Jason Philip came back from the inn, he said: &#8220;To believe
that people can be ruled without the knout is a fatal delusion.&#8221;
With that he stepped into his embroidered slippers&mdash;&#8220;For tired
Father&mdash;Consolation.&#8221; The slippers had aged, and so had Jason
Philip. His beard was streaked with grey.</p>

<p>Theresa took an invoice of the damage the mob had done: she
felt that Jason Philip was a ruined man.</p>

<p>As he lay stretched out in bed, Jason Philip said: &#8220;The first
thing I want to do is to have a serious, heart-to-heart talk with
Baron Auffenberg. The Liberal Party is going to take direct
action against the impudence of the lower classes, or it is going
to lose a constituent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many quarts of beer did you drink?&#8221; asked Theresa from
the depths of the pillows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a liar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, possibly I drank three,&#8221; replied Jason Philip with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>yawn. &#8220;But to accuse a man of my standing of lying on such
small grounds is an act of perfidy such as only an uncultured
woman like yourself could be brought to commit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Theresa blew out the candle.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Baron Siegmund von Auffenberg had returned from Munich,
where he had had an interview with the Minister.</p>

<p>He had also seen a great many other people in the presence
of whom he was condescending, jovial, and witty. His amiability
was proverbial.</p>

<p>Now he was sitting with a gloomy face by the chimney. Not
a one of those many people who had so recently been charmed by
his conversational gifts would have recognised him.</p>

<p>The stillness and loneliness pained him. An irresistible force
drew him to his wife. He had not seen her for seven weeks,
though they had lived in the same house.</p>

<p>He was drawn to her, because he wanted to know whether she
had heard anything from that person whose name he did not like
to mention, from his son, his enemy, his heir. Not that he wanted
to ask his wife any questions: he merely wished to read her face.
Since no one in the vicinity had dared say a word to him about
his son, he was forced to rely on suppositions and the subtle cunning
of his senses at ferreting out information on this kind of
subjects. He did not dare betray the curiosity with which he
waited for some one to inform him that his hated offspring had at
last come to mortal grief.</p>

<p>Six years had elapsed, and still he could hear the insolent voice
in which the monstrous remarks were made that had torn him from
the twilight of his self-complacency; remarks that distressed him
more than any other grief he may have felt in the secrecy of his
bed chamber and which completely and forever robbed him of all
the joys of human existence.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>D&eacute;p&ecirc;che-toi, mon bon gar&ccedil;on</i>,&#8221; screeched the parrot.</p>

<p>The Baron arose, and went to his wife&#8217;s room. She was terrified
when she saw him enter. She was lying on a sofa, her head
propped up by cushions, a thick Indian blanket spread out over
her legs.</p>

<p>She had a broad, bloated face, thick lips, and unusually big
black eyes, in which there was a sickly glare. She had been
regarded as a beauty in her young days, though none of this beauty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>was left, unless it was the freshness of her complexion or the
dignified bearing of the born lady of the world.</p>

<p>She sent her maid out of the room, and looked at her husband
in silence. She studied the friendly, Jesuitic wrinkles in his face,
by virtue of which he managed to conceal his real thoughts. Her
anxiety was increased.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not played the piano any to-day,&#8221; he began in a
sweet voice. &#8220;It makes the house seem as though something were
missing. I am told that you have acquired perfect technique, and
that you have engaged a new teacher. Emilia told me this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emilia was their daughter. She was married to Count Urlich,
captain of cavalry.</p>

<p>In the Baroness&#8217;s eyes there was an expression such as is found
in the eyes of some leashed beast when the butcher approaches, axe
in hand. She was tortured by the smoothness of the man from
whom she had never once in the last quarter of a century received
anything but brutality and scorn, and from whom she had suffered
the grossest of humiliations&mdash;when no one was listening.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want, Siegmund?&#8221; she asked, with painful effort.</p>

<p>The Baron stepped close up to her, bit his lips, and looked at
her for ten or twelve seconds with a fearful expression on his face.</p>

<p>She then seized him by the left arm: &#8220;What is the matter with
Eberhard?&#8221; she cried; &#8220;tell me, tell me everything! There is
something wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baron, with a gesture of stinging aversion, thrust her hands
from him, and turned to go. There was unfathomable coldness
in his conduct.</p>

<p>Beside herself with grief, the Baroness made up her mind to
tell him, for the first time in her life, of the thousand wrongs
that burned within her heart. And she did: &#8220;Oh, you monster!
Why did Fate bring you into my life? Where is there another
woman in the world whose lot has been like mine? Where is the
woman who has lived without joy or love or esteem or freedom or
peace, a burden to others and to herself? Show me another
woman who goes about in silk and satin longing for death. Name
me another woman who people think is happy, because the devil,
who tortures her without ceasing, deceives them all. Where is
there another woman who has been so shamelessly robbed of her
children? For is not my daughter the captive and concubine of an
insane tuft-hunter? Has not my son been taken from me through
the baseness that has been practised against his sister, and the
lamentable spectacle afforded him by my own powerlessness?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>Where, I ask high Heaven, is there another woman so cursed as I
have been?&#8221;</p>

<p>She threw herself down on her bosom, and burrowed her face
into the cushion.</p>

<p>The Baron was surprised at the feverish eloquence of his wife;
he had accustomed himself to her mute resignation, as he might
have accustomed himself to the regular, monotonous ticking of a
hall clock. He was anxious to see what she would do next, how
she would develop her excitement; she was a novel phenomenon
in his eyes: therefore he remained standing in the door.</p>

<p>But as he stood there in chilly expectancy, his haggard face
casting off expressions of scorn and surprise, he suddenly sensed a
feeling of weary disgust at himself. It was the disgust of a man
whose wishes had always been fulfilled, whose lusts had been satisfied;
of a man who has never known other men except as greedy
and practical supplicants; of a man who has always been the lord of
his friends, the tyrant of his servants, and the centre of all social
gatherings; of a man before whom all others yielded, to whom all
others bowed; of a man who had never renounced anything but
the feeling of renunciation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not unaware,&#8221; he began slowly, just as if he were making
a campaign speech to his electors, &#8220;I am not unaware that our
marriage has not been the source of wholesome blessings. To be
convinced of this, your declamation was unnecessary. We married
because the circumstances were favourable. We had cause to regret
the decision. Is it worth while to investigate the cause now? I
am quite devoid of sentimental needs. This is true of me to such
an extent that any display of sympathy or exuberance or lack of
harshness in other people fills me with mortal antipathy. Unfortunately,
my political career obliged me to assume a favourable
attitude toward this general tendency of the masses. I played the
hypocrite with complete consciousness of what I was doing, and
made so much the greater effort to conceal all feeling in my private
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is easy to conceal something you do not have,&#8221; replied the
Baroness in a tone of intense bitterness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly; but it is a poor display of tact for the rich man to
irritate the poor man by flaunting his lavish, spendthrift habits in
his face; and this is precisely what you have done. The emphasis
you laid on a certain possession of yours, the value of which we will
not dispute, provoked my contempt. It gave you pleasure to cry
when you saw a cat eating a sparrow. A banal newspaper novel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>could rob you completely of your spiritual equanimity. You were
always thrilled, always in ecstasy, it made not the slightest difference
whether the cause of your ecstasy was the first spring violet
or a thunder storm, a burnt roast, a sore throat, or a poem. You
were always raving, and I became tired of your raving. You did
not seem to notice that my distrust toward the expression of these
so-called feelings was transformed into coldness, impatience, and
hatred. And then came the music. What was at first a diversion
for you, of which one might approve or disapprove, became in time
the indemnity for an active life and all the defects of your character.
You gave yourself up to music somewhat as a prostitute
gives herself up to her first loyal lover&#8221;&mdash;the Baroness twitched
as if some one had struck her across the back with a horsewhip&mdash;&#8220;yes,
like a prostitute,&#8221; he repeated, turning paler and paler, his
eyes glistening. &#8220;Then it was that your whole character came to
light; one saw how spoiled you were, how helpless, how undisciplined.
You clung like a worm to uncertain and undetermined
conditions. If I have become a devil in your eyes, it is your music
that has made me so. Now you know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that is it,&#8221; whispered the Baroness with faltering breath.
&#8220;Did you leave me anything but my music? Have you not raged
like a tiger? But it is not true,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;you are not so
vicious, otherwise I myself would be a lie in the presence of the
Eternal Judge, and that I had borne children by you would be
contrary to nature. Leave me, go away, so that I may believe that
it is not true!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baron did not move.</p>

<p>In indescribable excitement, and as quickly as her obese body
would permit, the Baroness leaped to her feet: &#8220;I know you better,&#8221;
she said with trembling lips, &#8220;I have been able to foreshadow
what is driving you about; I have seen what makes you so restless.
You are not the man you pretend to be; you are not the
cold, heartless creature you seem. In your breast there is a spot
where you are vulnerable, and there you have been struck. You
are bleeding, man! If we all, I and your daughter and your
brothers and your friends and your cowardly creatures, are as
indifferent and despicable to you as so many flies, there is one who
has been able to wound you; this fact is gnawing at your heart.
And do you know why he was in a position to wound you? Because
you loved him. Look me in the eye, and tell me that I lie. You
loved him&mdash;your son&mdash;you idolised him. The fact that he has
repudiated your love, that he found it of no value to him, the love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>that blossomed on the ruined lives of his mother and sister, this is
the cause of your sorrow. It is written across your brow. And
that you are suffering, and suffering for this reason, constitutes
my revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baron did not say a word; his lower jaw wagged from left
to right as though he were chewing something; his face seemed
to have dried up; he looked as though he had suddenly become
older by years. The Baroness, driven from her reserve, stood
before him like an enraged sibyl. He turned in silence, and left
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;My suffering is her revenge,&#8221; he murmured on leaving the
room. Once alone, he stood for a while perfectly absent-minded.
&#8220;Am I really suffering?&#8221; he said to himself.</p>

<p>He turned off a gas jet that was burning above the book case.
&#8220;Yes, I am suffering,&#8221; he confessed reluctantly; &#8220;I am suffering.&#8221;
He walked along the wall with dragging feet, and entered a room
in which a light was burning. He felt the same satiety and disgust
at himself that he had experienced a few moments earlier.
This time it was caused by the sight of the hand-carved furniture,
the painted porcelain, the precious tapestries, and the oil paintings
in their gold frames.</p>

<p>He longed for simpler things; he longed for barren walls, a
cot of straw, parsimony, discipline. It was not the first time that
his exhausted organism had sought consolation in the thought of a
monastic life. This Protestant, this descendent of a long line of
Protestants, had long been tired of Protestantism. He regarded
the Roman Church as the more wholesome and merciful.</p>

<p>But the transformation of his religious views was his own carefully
guarded secret. And secret it had to remain until he, the
undisciplined son of his mother, could atone for his past misdeeds.
He decided to wait until this atonement had been effected. Just
as a hypnotist gains control of his medium by inner composure,
so he thought he could hasten the coming of this event by conceding
it absolute supremacy over his mind.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>When Eberhard von Auffenberg left the paternal home to strike
out for himself, he was as helpless as a child that has lost the
hand of its adult companion in a crowd.</p>

<p>He put the question to himself: What am I going to do? He
had never worked. He had studied at various universities as so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>many other young men have studied, that is, he had managed to
pass a few examinations by the skin of his teeth.</p>

<p>He had had so little to do in life, and was so utterly devoid of
ambition, that he looked upon a really ambitious individual as
being insane. Anything that was at all practical was filled with
insurmountable obstacles. His freedom, in other words, placed
him in a distressing state of mind and body.</p>

<p>It would not have been difficult for him to find people who
would have been willing to advance him money on his name. But
he did not wish to incur debts of which his father might hear.
If he did, his solemn solution of an unbearable relation would
have amounted to nothing.</p>

<p>He could, of course, count on his share of the estate; and he
did count on it, notwithstanding the fact that to do so was to
speculate on the death of his own father. He stood in urgent
need of a confidential friend; and this friend he thought he had
found in Herr Carovius.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, two people such as you and I will not insist upon unnecessary
formalities,&#8221; said Herr Carovius. &#8220;All that I need is your
face, and your signature to a piece of paper. We will deduct ten
per cent at the very outset, so that my expenses may be covered,
for money is dear at present. I will give you real estate bonds;
they are selling to-day at eighty-five, unfortunately. The Exchange
is a trifle spotty, but a little loss like that won&#8217;t mean anything
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the ten thousand marks that he owed, Eberhard received
seven thousand, six hundred and fifty, cash. In less than a year
he was again in need of money, and asked Herr Carovius for
twenty thousand. Herr Carovius said he did not have that much
ready money, and that he would have to approach a lender.</p>

<p>Eberhard replied sulkily that he could do about that as he saw
fit, but he must not mention his name to a third party. A few
days later Herr Carovius told a tale, of hair-splitting negotiations:
there was a middleman who demanded immodest guarantees, including
certified notes. He swore that he knew nothing about that
kind of business, and that he had undertaken to supply the needed
loan only because of his excessive affection for his young friend.</p>

<p>Eberhard was unmoved. The eel-like mobility of the man with
the squeaking voice did not please him; not at all; as a matter of
fact he began to dread him; and this dread increased in intensity
and fearfulness in proportion to the degree in which he felt he was
becoming more and more entangled in his net.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p><p>The twenty thousand marks were procured at an interest of
thirty-five per cent. At first Eberhard refused to sign the note.
He would not touch it until Herr Carovius had assured him that
it was not to be converted into currency, that it could be redeemed
with new loans at any time, and that it would lie in his strong-box
as peacefully as the bones of the Auffenberg ancestors rested in
their vaults. Eberhard, tired of this flood of words, yielded.</p>

<p>Every time he signed his name he had a feeling that the danger
into which he was walking was becoming greater. But he was too
lazy to defend himself; he was too aristocratic to interest himself
in petty explanations; and he was simply not capable of living on
a small income.</p>

<p>The endorsed notes were presented as a matter of warning;
new loans settled them; new loans made new notes necessary;
these were extended; the extensions were costly; an uncanny individual
shielded in anonymity was taken into confidence. He
bought up mortgages, paid for them in diamonds instead of money,
and sold depreciated stocks. The debts having reached a certain
height, Herr Carovius demanded that Eberhard have his life
insured. Eberhard had to do it; the premium was very high. In
the course of three years Eberhard had lost all perspective; he could
no longer survey his obligations. The money he received he spent
in the usual fashion, never bothered himself about the terms on
which he had secured it, and had no idea where all this was leading
to and where it was going to end. He turned in disgust from
Herr Carovius&#8217;s clumsy approaches, malicious gibes, and occasional
threats.</p>

<p>What an insipid smile he had! How fatuous, and then again
how profound, his conversation could be! He took upon himself
the impudent liberty of running in and out at Eberhard&#8217;s whenever
he felt like it. He bored him with his discussion of philosophic
systems, or with miserable gossip about his neighbours. He watched
him day and night.</p>

<p>He followed him on the street. He would come up to him
and cry out, &#8220;Herr Baron, Herr Baron!&#8221; and wave his hat. His
solicitude for Eberhard&#8217;s health resembled that of a gaoler. One
evening Eberhard went to bed with a fever. Herr Carovius ran
to the physician, and then spent the whole night by the bedside
of the patient, despite his entreaties to be left alone. &#8220;Would it
not be well for me to write to your mother?&#8221; he asked, with much
show of affection on the next morning when he noticed that the
fever had not fallen. Eberhard sprang from his bed with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>exclamation of rage, and Herr Carovius left immediately and
unceremoniously.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius loved to complain. He ran around the table,
exclaiming that he was ruined. He brought out his cheque book,
added up the figures, and cried: &#8220;Two more years of this business,
dear Baron, and I will be ready for the poor house.&#8221; He demanded
security and still more securities; he asked for renewed
promises. He submitted an account of the total sum, and demanded
an endorsement. But it was impossible for any one to make head
or tail out of this welter of interest, commissions, indemnities,
and usury. Herr Carovius himself no longer knew precisely how
matters stood; for a consortium of subsequent indorsers had been
formed behind his back, and they were exploiting his zeal on
behalf of the young Baron for all it was worth.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this I hear about you and the women?&#8221; asked Herr
Carovius one day. &#8220;What about a little adventure?&#8221; He had
noticed that the Baron had a secret; and it enraged him to think
that he could not get at the bottom of this amorous mystery.</p>

<p>He made this discovery one day as Eberhard was packing his
trunk. &#8220;Where are you going, my dear friend?&#8221; he crowed in
exclamatory dismay. Eberhard replied that he was going to Switzerland.
&#8220;To Switzerland? What are you going to do there? I
am not going to let you go,&#8221; said Herr Carovius. Eberhard gave
him one cold stare. Herr Carovius tried beseeching, begging,
pleading. It was in vain; Eberhard left for Switzerland. He
wanted to be alone; he became tired of being alone, and returned;
he went off again; he came back again, and had the conversation
with Eleanore that robbed him of his last hope. Then he went
to Munich, and took up with the spiritists.</p>

<p>Spiritual and mental ennui left him without a vestige of the
power of resistance. An inborn tendency to scepticism did not
prevent him from yielding to an influence which originally was
farther removed from the inclinations of his soul than the vulgar
bustle of everyday life. Benumbed as his critical judgment now
was, he went prospecting for the fountain of life in a zone where
dreams flourish and superficial enchantment predominates.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius hired a spy who never allowed Eberhard to get
out of his sight. He reported regularly to his employer on the
movements of the unique scion of the Auffenberg line. If Eberhard
needed money, he was forced to go to Carovius, who would
stand on the platform for an hour waiting for the Baron&#8217;s train
to come in; and once Eberhard had got out of his carriage, Herr
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>Carovius excited the laughter of the railroad officials by his
affectionate care for his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Delighted to see him again, he
would talk the sheerest nonsense, and trip around about his young
friend in groundless glee.</p>

<p>It seemed after all this that Herr Carovius really loved the
Baron; and he did.</p>

<p>He loved him as a gambler loves his cards, or as the fire loves
the coals. He idealised him; he dreamt about him; he liked to
breathe the air that Eberhard breathed; he saw a chosen being in
him; he imputed all manner of heroic deeds to him, and was
immeasurably pleased at his aristocratic offishness.</p>

<p>He loved him with hatred, with the joy of annihilation. This
hate-love became in time the centre of his thoughts and feelings.
In it was expressed everything that separated him from other men
and at the same time drew him to them. It controlled him unconditionally,
until a second, equally fearful and ridiculous passion
became affiliated with it.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Daniel had hesitated for a long while about making use of the
letter of introduction from Frau von Erfft. Gertrude then took
to begging him to go to the Baroness. &#8220;If I go merely to please
you, my action will avenge itself on you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I understood why you hesitate, I would not ask you,&#8221; she
replied in a tone of evident discomfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found so much there in Erfft,&#8221; said he, &#8220;so much human
kindness that was new to me; I dislike the idea of seeing some
ulterior motive back of it, or of putting one there myself. Do
you understand now?&#8221; She nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But must is stronger than may,&#8221; he concluded, and went.</p>

<p>The Baroness became quite interested in his case. The position
of second Kapellmeister at the City Theatre was vacant, and she
tried to have Daniel appointed to it. She was promised that it
would be given to him; but the usual intrigues were spun behind
her back; and when she urged that the matter be settled immediately
and in favour of her candidate, she was fed on dissembling
consolation. She was quite surprised to be brought face to face
with hostile opposition, which seemed to spring from every side
as if by agreement against the young musician. Not a single one
of his enemies, however, allowed themselves to be seen, and no
one heard from by correspondence. It was the first time that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>had come in conflict with the world in a business way; there was
something touching in her indignation at the display of cowardly
fraud.</p>

<p>Finally, after a long, and for her humiliating, interview with
that chief of cosmopolitan brokers, Alexander D&ouml;rmaul, Daniel&#8217;s
engagement for the coming spring was agreed upon.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Baroness took lessons from Daniel. She
expressed a desire to familiarise herself with the standard piano
compositions, and to be given a really practical introduction to their
meaning and the right method of interpreting them.</p>

<p>It was long before she became accustomed to his cold and
morose sternness. She had the feeling that he was pulling her out
of a nice warm bath into a cold, cutting draught. She longed
to return to her twilights, her ecstatic moods, her melancholy
reveries.</p>

<p>Once he explained to her in a thoroughly matter-of-fact way the
movement of a fugue. She dared to burst out with an exclamation
of joy. He shut the piano with a bang, and said: &#8220;Adieu,
Baroness.&#8221; He did not return until she had written him a letter
asking him to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it is lost effort, a waste of time,&#8221; he thought, though he
did not fail to appreciate the Baroness&#8217;s human dignity. The
eight hours a month were a complete torture to him. And yet he
found that twenty marks an hour was too much; he said so. The
suspicion that she was giving him alms made him exceedingly disagreeable.</p>

<p>A servant became familiar with him. Daniel took him by the
collar and shook him until he was blue in the face. He was as
wiry as a jaguar, and much to be feared when angry. The
Baroness had to discharge the servant.</p>

<p>Once the Baroness showed him an antique of glass work made
of mountain crystal and beautifully painted. As he was looking
at it in intense admiration, he let it fall; it broke into many pieces.
He was as humiliated as a whipped school boy; the old Baroness
had to use her choicest powers of persuasion to calm him. He
then played the whole of Schumann&#8217;s &#8220;Carneval&#8221; for her, a piece
of music of which she was passionately fond.</p>

<p>Every forenoon you could see him hastening across the bridge.
He always walked rapidly; his coat tails flew. He always had
the corners of his mouth drawn up and his lower lip clenched
between his teeth. He was always looking at the ground; in the
densest crowds he seemed to be alone. He bent the rim of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>hat down so that it covered his forehead. His dangling arms
resembled the stumpy wings of a penguin.</p>

<p>At times he would stop, stand all alone, and listen, so to speak,
into space without seeing. When he did this, street boys would
gather about him and grin. Once upon a time a little boy said to
his mother: &#8220;Tell me, mother, who is that old, old manikin over
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the picture we must form of him at this time of his life,
just before his years of real storm and stress: he is in a hurry;
he seems so aloof, sullen, distant, and dry; he is whipped about the
narrow circle of his everyday life by fancy and ambition; he is
so young and yet so old. This is the light in which we must
see him.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The apartment of Daniel and Gertrude had three rooms. Two
opened on the street, and one, the bed room, faced a dark, gloomy
court.</p>

<p>With very limited means, but with diligence and pleasure,
Gertrude had done all in her power to make the apartment as
comfortable as possible. Though the ceilings were low and the
walls almost always damp, the rooms seemed after all quite home-like
and attractive.</p>

<p>In Daniel&#8217;s study the piano was the chief object of furniture; it
dominated the space. Fuchsias in the window gave a pleasing
frame to the general picture of penury. His mother had given
him the oil painting of his father. From its place above the
sofa the stern countenance of Gottfried Nothafft looked down
upon the son. It seemed at times that the face of the father
turned toward the mask of Zingarella as if to ask who and what it
was. The mask hung on the other side of the room from the oil
painting; its unbroken smile was lost in the shadows.</p>

<p>Gertrude had to do all the household work; they could not
afford a servant. In the years of Daniel&#8217;s absence, however, she
had learned to copy notes. Herr Seelenfromm, assistant to the
apothecary Pflaum, had taught her. He was a cousin of Frau
R&uuml;bsam, and she had become acquainted with him through Eleanore.
In his leisure hours he composed waltzes and marches, and dedicated
them to the princes and princesses of the royal family. He
also dedicated one to Gertrude. It was entitled &#8220;Feenzauber,&#8221;
and was a gavotte.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p><p>When Daniel learned of her accomplishment, he was so astonished
that he threw his hands above his head. The rare being
looked up at him intoxicated with joy. &#8220;I will help you,&#8221; she
said, and copied his notes for him.</p>

<p>When they walked along the streets she would close her eyes at
times. A melody floated by her which she had never before been
able to understand. As she bought her vegetables and tried to drive
a bargain with the old market woman, her soul was full of song.</p>

<p>Certain tones and combinations of tones took on definite shapes
in her mind. The bass B of the fourth octave appeared to her
as a heavily veiled woman; the middle E resembled a young man
who was stretching his arms. In chords, harmonies, and harmonic
transformations these figures were set in motion, the motion
depending on the character of the composition: a procession of
mourning figures between clouds and stars; wild animals spurred
on by the huntsmen who were riding them; maidens throwing
flowers from the windows of a palace; men and women plunging
into an abyss in one mass of despairing humanity; weeping men
and laughing women, wrestlers and ball players, dancing couples
and grape pickers. The pause appealed to her as a man who climbs
naked from a deep subterranean shaft, carrying a burning torch in
his hand; the trill seemed like a bird that anxiously flutters about
its nest.</p>

<p>All of Daniel&#8217;s compositions came close to her heart; all his
pictures were highly coloured; his figures seemed to be full of
blood. If they remained dead and distant, her sympathy vanished;
her face became tired and empty. Without having spoken a word
with each other, Daniel would know that he was on the wrong
track. But all this bound him to the young woman with hoops of
steel; he came to regard her as the creature given him of God to
act as his living conscience and infallible if mute judge.</p>

<p>He hated her when her feelings remained unmoved. If he at
last came to see, after much introspection, that she was right, then
he would have liked to fall down and worship the unknown power
that was so inexorable in pointing him the way.</p>

<p>Spindler had a beautiful harp which he had bequeathed to
Daniel in his will. It had remained in Ansbach in the possession
of the old lady who kept house for him. Daniel had forgotten all
about the harp. After his marriage he had it sent to him.</p>

<p>He kept it in the living room; Gertrude was fond of looking
at it. It enticed her. One day she sat down and tried to draw
tones from its strings. She touched the strings very gently, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>was charmed with the melody that came from them. Gradually
she learned the secret; she discovered the law. An innate talent
made the instrument submissive to her; she was able to express on
it all the longings and emotions she had experienced in her dark
and lonely hours.</p>

<p>She generally played very softly; she never tried intricate
melodies, for the harp was adapted to the expression of simple,
dream-like harmonies. The tones were wafted out into the hall
and up the stairs; they greeted Daniel as he entered the old house.</p>

<p>When he came into the room, Gertrude was sitting in a corner
by the stove, the harp between her knees. She smiled mysteriously
to herself; her hands, like strange beings loosed from her body,
sought chords and melodies that were his, and which she was trying
to translate to her own world of dreams.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Her command of language was more defective now than ever.
She was seized with painful astonishment when she noticed that
in matters of daily intercourse Daniel&#8217;s mind was not able to
penetrate the veil behind which she lived.</p>

<p>He said to himself: she is too heavy. He was dumbfounded at
her conduct, and displeased with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gloomy house oppresses you,&#8221; he said in a tone of ill
humour, when she smiled in her helpless way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us run a race,&#8221; he said to her one day as they were taking
a walk through the country. An old tree in the distance that had
been struck by lightning was to be their objective.</p>

<p>They ran as fast as their feet could carry them. At a distance
of about ten metres from the tree, Gertrude collapsed. He carried
her over to the meadow.</p>

<p>&#8220;How heavy you are,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too heavy for you?&#8221; she asked with wide-opened eyes. He
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Then she slipped out of his embrace, sprang to her feet, and
ran with remarkable swiftness a distance that was twice as long
as the one he had staked off; she did not fall; she did not want
to fall; she dared not.</p>

<p>Breathing heavily and pale as a corpse, she waited until he came
up. But he had no tenderness for her now; he merely scolded.
Arm in arm they walked on. Gertrude felt for his hand; he
gave it to her, and she pressed it to her bosom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p><p>Daniel was terrified as he looked into her face, and saw her
thoughts written there as if in letters of fire: We belong to each
other for time and eternity.</p>

<p>That was her confession of faith.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>She lay wide awake until late at night. She heard him go into
the kitchen and get a drink of water and then return to his room.
He had forbidden her to come to the door and ask whether he was
not going to bed soon: she was not to do this, it made no difference
how late it was.</p>

<p>Then he lay beside her, his head on his arm, and looked at her
with eyes that had lost their earthly, temporal glow. Man, where
are your eyes anyway, she would have liked to exclaim. And yet
she knew where they were; she knew, too, that it is dangerous to
disturb a somnambulist by calling to him.</p>

<p>One night he had found it impossible to do his work. He sat
down on the edge of the bed and stared into the light of the
lamp for an hour or so, hating himself. Gertrude saw how he
raged at himself; how he really fed, nourished his lack of confidence
in himself. But she could not say anything.</p>

<p>A publisher had returned one of his manuscripts with a courteous
but depressing conventional rejection slip. Daniel spoke
disparagingly of his talents; he had lost hope in his future; he
was bitter at the world; he felt that he was condemned to a life
of unceasing obscurity.</p>

<p>The only thing she could do was look at him; merely look
at him.</p>

<p>He became tired of having her look at him; a fresh, vigorous
remark would have served his purpose much better, he thought.</p>

<p>She measured her work and his not in terms of reward; she did
not seek for connection of any kind between privation and hope;
nor did she measure Daniel&#8217;s love in terms of tender expressions
and embraces. She waited for him with much patience. In time
her patience irritated him. &#8220;A little bit more activity and insistence
would not hurt you,&#8221; he said one day, and thrust her timid,
beseeching hands from him.</p>

<p>He saw himself cared for: He had a home, a person who prepared
his meals, washed his clothes, and faithfully attended to his
other household needs. He should have been grateful. He was,
too, but he could not show it. He was grateful when he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>alone, but in Gertrude&#8217;s presence his gratitude turned to defiance.
If he was away from home, he thought with pleasure of his
return; he pictured Gertrude&#8217;s joy at seeing him again. But when
he was with her, he indulged in silent criticism, and wanted to have
everything about her different.</p>

<p>The judge&#8217;s wife on the first floor complained that Gertrude
did not speak to her. &#8220;Be kind to your neighbours,&#8221; he remarked
with the air of a professional scold. The next Sunday they took
a walk, on which they met the judge&#8217;s wife. Gertrude spoke to
her: &#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t need to fall on her neck,&#8221; he mumbled.
She thought for a long while of how she might speak to people
without offending them and without annoying Daniel. She was
embarrassed; she was afraid of Daniel&#8217;s criticism.</p>

<p>On such days she would put too much salt in the soup, everything
went wrong, and in her diligent attempt to be punctual she
lost much time. She was fearfully worried when he got up from
the table and went to his room without saying a word. She
would sit perfectly still and listen; she was frightened when he
went to the piano to try a motif. When he again entered her
room, she looked into his face with the tenseness of a soul in utter
anguish. Then it suddenly came about that he would sit down by
her side and caress her. He told her all about his life, his home,
his father, his mother. If she could only have heard each of his
words twice! If she could only have drunk in the expression in
his eyes! They were filled with peace; his nervous hands lay in
quiet on his knees when he spoke to her in this way on these subjects.
His twitching, angular face, weather-beaten by the storms
of life, took on an expression of sorrow that was most becoming
to it.</p>

<p>When she had a headache or was tired, he expressed his anxiety
for her in touching tones. He would go about the house on
tiptoes, and close the doors with infinite care. If a dog barked
on the street, he rushed to the window and looked out, enraged at
the beast. When she retired, he would help her undress, and
bring her whatever she needed.</p>

<p>It was also strange that he disliked the idea of leaving her alone.
There was something child-like in his restlessness when he was at
home and she was out. He pictured her surrounded by grievous
dangers; he would have liked to lock her up and hold her a captive,
so as to be sure that she was quite safe. This made her all
the weaker and more dependent upon him, while he was like a
man who presses what he has to his heart, plagued with the thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>that by some mischance it might escape, and yet clings to it also
lest he be disturbed by the thought of another more precious possession
he loved long since and lost a while.</p>

<p>Once he came to Gertrude while she was playing the harp, threw
his arms about her, looked into her face with a wild, gloomy expression,
and stammered: &#8220;I love you, I love you, I do.&#8221; It was the
first time he had spoken these eternal words. She grew pale, first
from joy and then from fear; for there was more of hatred than
of love in his voice.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>He felt that association with congenial men would help him over
many a dark hour. But when he set out to look for these men,
the city became a desert and a waste place.</p>

<p>Herr Seelenfromm came to his house now and then. Daniel
could not endure the timid man who admired him so profoundly,
and who, in the bottom of his heart, had an equal amount of respect
for Gertrude. The young architect who had been employed at
the St. Sebaldus Church while it was being renovated, and who
loved music, had won Daniel&#8217;s esteem. But he had a repulsive
habit of smacking his tongue when he talked. Daniel and he discussed
the habit, and parted the worst of enemies. His association
with a certain Frenchman by the name of Rivi&egrave;re was of longer
duration. Rivi&egrave;re was spending some time in the city, looking up
material for a life of Caspar Hauser. He had made his acquaintance
at the Baroness von Auffenberg&#8217;s, and taken a liking to him
because he reminded him of Friedrich Benda.</p>

<p>M. Rivi&egrave;re loved to hear Daniel improvise on the piano. He
knew so little German that he merely smiled at Daniel&#8217;s caustic
remarks; and if he became violently enraged, M. Rivi&egrave;re merely
stared at his mouth. He had a wart on his cheek, and wore a
straw hat summer and winter. He cooked his own meals, for it
was an obsession of his that people wanted to poison him because
he was writing a life of Caspar Hauser.</p>

<p>When Herr Seelenfromm and M. Rivi&egrave;re came in of a Sunday
evening, Daniel would reach for a volume of E. T. A. Hoffmann
or Clemens Brentano, and read from them until he was hoarse.
He tried in this way to find peace in a strange world; for he did
not wish to weep at the sight of human beings who seemed perfectly
at ease.</p>

<p>Gertrude looked at him, and put this question to herself: How
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>is it that a man to whom music is life and the paradise of his heart
can allow himself to be so enveloped in sorrow, so beclouded by
gloom? She understood the smarting pains in which he composed;
she had a vague idea of the labyrinthine complications of his inner
fate; these she grasped. But her own soul was filled with joyless
compassion; she wished with all her power to plant greater faith
and more happiness in his heart.</p>

<p>She meditated on the best means of carrying on her spiritual
campaign. It occurred to her that he had had more of both faith
and happiness at the time he was going with Eleanore. She saw
Eleanore now in a quite different light. She recalled that Eleanore
was not merely her sister but the creator of her happiness. Nor
was she unmindful of the fact that through the transformation
of her being, love and enlightenment had arisen to take the place
of her former suspicion and ignorance.</p>

<p>She ascribed to Eleanore all those powers in which she had
formerly been lacking: general superiority and stimulating vigour;
an ability to play that lent charm to drudgery and made the hard
things of life easy; brightness in conversation and delicacy of
touch. In her lonely broodings she came to the conclusion that
Eleanore was the only one who could help her. She went straightway
to her father&#8217;s house to find out why Eleanore so rarely came
to see her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to come; Daniel is so unkind to me,&#8221; said Eleanore.</p>

<p>Gertrude replied that he was unkind to everybody, including
her herself, and that she must not pay any attention to this; for
she knew full well that Daniel liked her&mdash;and perhaps he himself
was offended because she never called.</p>

<p>Eleanore thought it all over, and from then on visited her sister
more frequently. But if it did not look as though Daniel did
everything in his power to avoid her, this much was certain: he
never said a word to her more than human decency required, and
was an expert at finding reasons why he had to leave the room
when she was there. Eleanore was gainfully conscious of this;
it hurt her.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>One morning Gertrude returned from the market, carrying a
heavy basket full of things she had bought. As she came in the
front door she heard Daniel playing. She noticed at once that he
was not improvising; that he was playing a set piece, the tones
of which were quite unfamiliar to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p><p>As she came up the steps, the basket no longer seemed like a
burden. She went quietly into the living room and listened.
Something drew her closer and closer to the piano. Daniel had
not noticed that she had entered the room and sat down. He was
wholly lost in what he was doing; he never took his rapt and
wondering eyes from the music before him.</p>

<p>It was his draft of the &#8220;Harzreise im Winter.&#8221; For a year
and a half, since the time he had composed it in Ansbach, he had
never again thought of it; it had lain untouched. Suddenly the
fire of creation had flamed up in him; he could once more bind the
incoherent, and make what had been merely implied or indicated
take definite shape.</p>

<p>He would play a movement again and again, trying to connect
it with what went before or came after; he would take his pencil
and write in a few notes here or there; then he would try it again,
and smile to himself in a strange, confused, and yet enchanted
way, when he saw that the motif was complete, perfect. Gertrude
was drawn still closer to him. In her awe-struck admiration she
crouched on the floor beside him. She would have liked to creep
into the piano, and give her soul the opportunity it sought to
express itself in the tones that came from the strings. When
Daniel had finished, she pressed her head to his hips, and reached
her hot hands up to him.</p>

<p>Daniel was terrified; for he recalled instantaneously another
occasion on which another woman had done precisely the same
thing. His eye involuntarily fell on the mask of Zingarella.
He was not conscious of the connection; there was no visible bridge
between the two incidents; Gertrude&#8217;s face was too unlike that of
its momentary prototype. But with a feeling of awe he detected
a mysterious liaison between then and now: he imagined he could
hear a voice calling to him from the distant shores of yonder
world.</p>

<p>He laid his hand on Gertrude&#8217;s hair. She interpreted the gesture
as a visible sign that his promise had been fulfilled; that this
work belonged to her; that he had created it for her, had taken it
from her heart, and was returning it to the heart from whence
it came.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Zierfuss, the music dealer, had sent out invitations to a concert.
Daniel did not feel like going. Gertrude asked Eleanore if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>she would not go with her. Daniel called for them after the
concert.</p>

<p>Eleanore told him on the way home that she had received a
letter for him that afternoon bearing a London stamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;From Benda?&#8221; asked Daniel quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Benda&#8217;s handwriting,&#8221; replied Eleanore. &#8220;I was going to
bring it to you when Gertrude called for me. Wait out in the
front of the house, and I&#8217;ll go in and get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take dinner with us this evening, Eleanore,&#8221; said Gertrude,
looking rather uncertainly at Daniel.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is agreeable to Daniel....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No nonsense, Eleanore, of course it is agreeable to me,&#8221; said
Daniel.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later Daniel was sitting by the lamp reading
Benda&#8217;s letter.</p>

<p>The first thing his friend told him was that he was to join a
scientific expedition to the Congo, and that his party would follow
almost exactly the same route that had been taken by the Stanley
Expedition when it set out to look for Emin Pascha.</p>

<p>Benda wrote: &#8220;This letter then, my dear friend, is written to
say good-bye for a number of years, perhaps forever. I feel as if
I had been born anew. I have eyes again; and the ideas that fill
my brain are no longer condemned to be stifled in the morass of
imprisoned colleagues, loyal and inimical. To labour in nature&#8217;s
laboratory will make me forget the wrongs I have suffered, the
injustice that has been done me. Hunger and thirst, disease and
danger will of course have to be endured; they are the effects of
those crimes of civilisation that spare the body while they poison
the mind and soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>Further on Benda wrote: &#8220;I am bound to my home by only two
people, my mother and you. When I think of you, a feeling of
pride comes over me; every hour we spent together is indelibly
stamped on my heart. But there is one delicate point: it is a
point of conscience. Call it, so far as I am concerned, a chip; call
it anything you please. The fact is I have had a Don Quixotic
run in, and I have got to defend myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel shook his head and read on. Benda knew nothing of
his marriage. He did not even seem to know that Daniel and
Gertrude had been engaged. Or if he had known it he had
forgotten it. Daniel could hardly believe his own eyes when he
came to the following passage: &#8220;My greatest anxiety always lay
in the fear that you would pass Eleanore by. I was too cowardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>to tell you how I felt on this point, and I have reproached myself
ever since for my cowardice. Now that I am leaving I tell you
how I feel about this matter, though not exactly with the sensation
of performing a belated task.&#8221;</p>

<p>For Heaven&#8217;s sake, thought Daniel, what is he trying to do to
me?</p>

<p>&#8220;I have often thought about it in quiet hours; it gave me the
same feeling of satisfaction that I have in a chemical experiment,
when the reactions of the various elements take place as they should:
what Eleanore says is your word; what you feel is Eleanore&#8217;s
law.&#8221;</p>

<p>He is seeing ghosts, cried Daniel, he is tangling up the threads
of my life. What does he mean? Why does he do it?</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t neglect what I am telling you! Don&#8217;t crush that wonderful
flower! The girl is a rare specimen; the rarest I know.
You need your whole heart with all its powers of love and kindness
to appreciate her. But if my words reach you too late, please tear
this letter into shreds, and get the whole idea out of your mind
as soon and completely as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let&#8217;s eat,&#8221; said Gertrude, as she entered the room with
a dish of pickled herring.</p>

<p>Eleanore was sitting on the sofa looking at Daniel quizzically.
He was lost in thought.</p>

<p>Daniel looked up, and studied the two women as if they were
the figures of a hallucination: the one in dark red, the other in
dark blue; minor and major keys. The two stood side by side,
and yet so far removed from each other: they were the two poles
of his world.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>&#8220;What has Benda got to say?&#8221; asked Gertrude hesitatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just think, he is going to Africa,&#8221; replied Daniel, with a voice
as if he were lying. &#8220;Curious, isn&#8217;t it? I suppose he is on the
ocean by this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>With an expression on his face that clearly betrayed the fact
that he was afraid the sisters might somehow divine or suspect the
parts of the letter he wished to keep to himself, he read as much
of it as he dared to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you read on?&#8221; asked Eleanore, when he paused.</p>

<p>She bent over the table, filled with a burning curiosity to know
the whole contents of the letter, and while so doing her hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>became entangled in the metal bric-a-brac of the hanging lamp.
Gertrude got up and liberated her.</p>

<p>Daniel had laid his hand over the letter, and was looking at
Eleanore threateningly. His eye and that of the captured girl
chanced to meet; she struggled between a feeling of amusement
and one of annoyance. It gave Daniel an uncomfortable feeling to
have her eyes so close to his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that that is not polite?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;We have
some secrets, probably, Benda and I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I merely thought that Benda had sent me his greetings,&#8221; replied
Eleanore, and blushed with embarrassment.</p>

<p>Daniel then held the letter above the chimney of the lamp,
waited until it had caught fire, and then threw it on the floor,
where it burned up.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is late, and father is already waiting,&#8221; said Eleanore, after
they had eaten in great haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take you home,&#8221; declared Daniel. Surprised by such
unusual gallantry, Eleanore looked at him with amazement. He
at once became moody; she was still more surprised. &#8220;I can go
home alone, Daniel,&#8221; she said in a tone of noticeable seriousness,
&#8220;you do not need to put yourself out for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put myself out? What do you mean? Are you one of those
people who can&#8217;t keep a tune, and step on the pedal when their
sentiment runs short?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore had nothing to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put your great coat on, Daniel,&#8221; said Gertrude in the hall,
&#8220;it is cold and windy out.&#8221;</p>

<p>She wanted to help him on with it, but he threw it in the
clothes press; he was irritated.</p>

<p>He walked along at Eleanore&#8217;s side through the deserted streets.</p>

<p>She had already put the key in the front door, when she turned
around, looked up in a most unhappy way, and said: &#8220;Daniel, what
in the world is the matter with you? When I look at you, a feeling
of anguish and distress comes over me. What have I done
that you should act so disagreeably toward me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, forget it, think about something else, don&#8217;t mention the
subject any more,&#8221; said Daniel, in a rough, rude voice. But the
glance she fixed on him was so stern and unpitying, so testing and
so un-girl-like, so strong and so bold, that he felt his heart grow
softer. &#8220;Let us take a little walk,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>For a long time they paced back and forth in perfect silence.
Then she asked him what he was working on now. He made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>cautious, non-committal replies, and then suddenly he was overwhelmed
with a flood of words. He remarked that he felt at
times as if he were struggling with goblins in the dark. What
gushed forth from the deepest depths of his soul, he said, was
somehow or other too noisy and blatant, and died in his hands
while he was trying to create an appropriate form for it. He said
he had no success with anything unless it was something disembodied,
incorporeal, the melody of which had thus far found an
echo in no human breast. Therefore he seemed to be groping
around, without anchorage, after sprites from the land of nowhere.
And the more domineering the order was to which he subjected
his mind and his fancy, the more lost and hopeless his earthly self
seemed to be as it drifted in the chaos of the everyday world.
He remarked that heaven was in his dreams, hell in his association
with men. And how dead everything about him seemed to be!
It was all like a cemetery; it was a cemetery. His doughtiest life
was gradually transformed into a shadow and lacerated into a monstrosity.
But that he was aggrieved at men he felt full well; for
they lived more innocent lives than he, and they were more useful.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have some one to hold to,&#8221; said Eleanore, realising that
she was skating on thin ice, &#8220;you have Gertrude.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this he made no reply. She waited for him to say something,
and when she saw that he did not care to make a reply of
any kind, she smiled at him as if in a last attempt to get him to
tell her what was the matter. Then all peace of mind vanished
from her soul&mdash;and her face. Every time they passed a
street lamp she turned her head to one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is after all in the presence of God your wife,&#8221; said
Eleanore gently and with remarkable solemnity.</p>

<p>Daniel looked up and listened as if greatly abashed. Speaking
out into the wind he said: &#8220;The over-tone, Eleanore; a bird twittering
in the bush. In the presence of God my wife! But in the
roots the bass is howling; it is an infernal tremolo; do you hear it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed as if mad, and his face, with his spotted teeth, was
turned toward her. She took him by the arm, and implored him
to straighten up.</p>

<p>He pressed her hand to his forehead, and said: &#8220;The letter,
Eleanore, the letter&nbsp;...!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you see, Daniel, I knew it all along. What was in the
letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not tell you, otherwise my sweet over-tone will take a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>somersault, become mingled with the gloomy bass, and be lost
forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore looked at him in amazement; he had never seemed
so much like a fool to her in her life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; he said, putting his arm in hers, &#8220;I have composed a
song; here is the way it goes.&#8221; He sang a melody he had written
for one of Eichendorff&#8217;s poems. In it there was a tender sadness.
&#8220;While everything is still and everybody asleep, my soul greets
the eternal light, and rests like a ship in the harbour.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had again reached the front door; they had been strolling
back and forth for two hours.</p>

<p>He had an unpleasant feeling when he went up the steps of
his apartment.</p>

<p>Gertrude was sitting where he had left her: by the clothes
press. She had wrapped his top coat about her legs, her back was
leaning against the wall, her head had sunk on her shoulder; she
was asleep. She was not awakened by his coming. Beside her
stood the candle, now burned down to the edge of the metal
holder; it was spluttering. The light from it fell on Gertrude&#8217;s
face, lighting it up irregularly and lending it a painful expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the presence of God my wife,&#8221; murmured Daniel. He
did not waken Gertrude until the candle had gone out. Then he
did; she got up, and the two went off in darkness to their bed
room.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Daniel</span> wished to see Eleanore skate; he went out to the Maxfeld
at a time he knew she would be there.</p>

<p>He saw her quite soon, and was delighted when she glided by;
but when she was lost in the crowd, he frowned. High school
boys followed her with cowardly and obtrusive forwardness. One
student, who wore a red cap, fell flat on his stomach as he bowed
to her.</p>

<p>She ran into two army officers, or they into her; this put an
end for the time being to the inspired grace of her movement.
When she started off a second time, drawing a beautiful circle, she
saw Daniel and came over to him. She smiled in a confidential
way, chatted with him, glided backwards in a circle about him,
laughed at his impatience because she would not stand still, threw
her muff over to him, asked him to throw it back, and, with arms
raised to catch it, cut an artistic figure on the ice.</p>

<p>The picture she offered filled Daniel with reverence for the
harmony of her being.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>They frequently took walks after sunset out to the suburbs
and up to the castle. Gertrude was pleased to see that Daniel and
Eleanore were good friends again.</p>

<p>One time when they walked up the castle hill, Eleanore told
Daniel that there was where she had taken leave of Eberhard von
Auffenberg. She could recall everything he said, and she confessed
with marked candour what she had said in reply. The
story about the old herb woman Daniel did not find amusing. He
stopped, and said: &#8220;Child, don&#8217;t have anything to do with spirits!
Never interfere with your lovely reality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk in that way,&#8221; replied Eleanore. &#8220;I dislike it. The
tone of your voice and the expression on your face make me feel
as if I were a woman of worldly habits.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p><p>They went into the Church of St. Sebaldus, and revelled in the
beauty of the bronze castings on the tomb of the saint. They
also went to the Germanic Museum, where they loved to wander
around in the countless deserted passage-ways, stopped and studied
the pictures, and never tired of looking at the old toys, globes,
kitchen utensils, and armour.</p>

<p>Eleanore&#8217;s greatest pleasure, however, was derived from sauntering
through the narrow alleys. She like to stand in an open door,
and look into the court at some weather-beaten statue; to stand
before the window of an antique shop, and study the brocaded
objects, silver chains, rings with gaudy stones, engraved plates, and
rare clocks. All manner of roguish ideas came to her mind, and
around every wish she wove a fairy tale. The meagrest incident
sufficed to send her imagination to the land of wonders, just as if
the fables and legends that the people had been passing on from
hearth to hearth for centuries were leading a life of reality over
there.</p>

<p>The tailor sitting with crossed legs on his table; the smith hammering
the red-hot iron; the juggler who made the rounds of the
city with the trained monkey; the Jewish pawnbroker, the chimney
sweep, the one-legged veteran, an old woman who looked out from
some cellar, a spider&#8217;s nest in the corner of a wall&mdash;around all
these things and still others she wound her tale of weal or woe. It
seemed that what she saw had never been seen by mortal eyes
before. It seemed that the things or people that attracted her
attention had not existed until she had seen them. For this reason
she was never in a bad humour, never bored, never lazy, never
tired.</p>

<p>There was something about her, however, that Daniel could not
understand. He did not know wherein the riddle lay, he merely
knew that there was one. If she gave him her hand, it seemed
to him that there was something unreal about it. If he requested
that she look at him, she did so, but it seemed that her glance was
divided, half going to the left, half to the right, neither meeting
his. If she came so close to him that their arms touched, he had
the feeling that he could not take hold of her if he wished to.</p>

<p>He struggled against the enticement that lay in this peculiarity.</p>

<p>Her presence ennobled his ambition and dispelled his whims.
She gave him the beautifully formed cloud, the tree covered with
young foliage, the moon that rises up over the roofs of the houses&mdash;she
gave him the whole earth over which he was hastening, a
stranger to peace, unfamiliar with contentment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p><p>He cherished no suspicion; he had no foreshadowing of his
fate. And Eleanore was not afraid of him; she, too, was without
a sense of danger.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>One Sunday afternoon in April they took a walk out into the
country. Gertrude had been suffering for weeks from lassitude
and could not go with them.</p>

<p>Eleanore was a superb walker. It gave Daniel extreme pleasure
to walk along with her, keeping step, moving hastily. The quick
movement increased his susceptibility to the charm of the changing
landscapes. It was quite different when he walked with Gertrude.
She was slow, given to introspection, thoughtful, and not very
strong.</p>

<p>In the course of an hour clouds gathered in the sky, the sun
disappeared, big drops began to fall. Eleanore had taken neither
umbrella nor rain coat along; she began to walk more rapidly. If
they tried, they could reach the inn beyond the forest, and find
shelter from the storm.</p>

<p>Just as they slipped through the crowd that had hurried up the
road to the same refuge and entered the inn, the sluices of heaven
seemed to open, and a cloud-burst followed. They were standing
in the hall. Eleanore was warm, and did not wish to remain in
the draught. They went into the restaurant; it was so full that
they had considerable trouble to find seats. A working man, his
wife, and four sickly-looking children squeezed up more closely
together; the two youngest boys gave them their chairs and went to
look for others.</p>

<p>The clouds hung low, causing premature darkness. Lamps were
lighted, and their odour mingled freely with the other odours of
this overcrowded room. A few village musicians played some
unknown piece; the eyes of the workingman&#8217;s children shone with
delight. Because they sat there so quietly&mdash;and because they looked
so pale&mdash;Eleanore gave each of the children a sandwich. The
mother was very grateful, and said so. The father, who said he
was the foreman in a mirror factory, began to talk with Daniel
about the troubles of the present era.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Daniel caught sight of a familiar face at a
nearby table. As it turned to one side, he saw in the dim, smelly
light another face he knew, and then a third and a fourth. It
was all so ghost-like in the room that it was some time before he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>knew just where to place them. Then it occurred to him where
they came from.</p>

<p>Herr Hadebusch and Frau Hadebusch, Herr Francke and
Benjamin Dorn were having a little Sunday outing. The brush-maker&#8217;s
wife was radiant with joy on seeing her old lodger. She
nodded, she blinked, she folded her hands as if touched at the
sight, and Herr Hadebusch raised his beer glass, eager to drink a
toast to Daniel&#8217;s health.</p>

<p>They could not quite make out who Eleanore was; they took
her for Daniel&#8217;s wife. This misunderstanding, it seemed, was
then cleared up by the Methodist after he had craned his neck and
called his powers of recognition into play. The demoniac woman
nodded, to be sure, and kept on blinking, but in her face there was
an expression of rustic disapproval. Her mouth was opened, and
the tusks of her upper jaw shone forth uncannily from the black
abyss.</p>

<p>The swan neck of the Methodist was screwed up so hardily
and picturesquely above the heads of the others that Eleanore
could not help but notice his physical and spiritual peculiarities.
She wrinkled her brow, and looked at Daniel questioningly.</p>

<p>She looked around, and saw a great many people from the city
whom she knew either by name or from having met them so frequently.
There was a saleswoman from Ludwig Street; a clerk
with a pock-marked face from a produce store; the dignified
preceptress of a Kindergarten; an official of the savings bank; the
hat-maker from the corner of the Market Place with his grown
daughter; and the sergeant who invariably saluted when he passed
by her.</p>

<p>All these people were in their Sunday clothes and seemed care-free
and good natured. But as soon as they saw Eleanore a mean
expression came over them. The fluttering of the lights made
their faces look ghastly, while partial intoxication made it easy
to read their filthy, lazy thoughts. Full of anxiety, Eleanore
looked up at Daniel, as if she felt she would have to rely on his
wealth of experience and greater superiority in general.</p>

<p>He was sorry for her and sorry for himself. He knew what
was in store for him and her. When he looked over this Hogarthian
gathering, and saw, despite its festive, convivial mood, hidden
lusts of every description, crippled passions, secreted envy, and
mysterious vindictiveness spread about like the stench of foul
blood, he felt it was quite futile to cherish delusions of any kind
as to what was before him. To spare Eleanore and to defend her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>to leave her rather than be guilty of causing the child-like smile
on her lips to die out and disappear forever&mdash;this he believed in
the bottom of his heart he could promise both her and himself.</p>

<p>The working man and his family had left; and as it was no
longer raining, most of the other guests had also gone. Up in
the room above people were dancing. The lamps were shaking,
and it was easy to hear the low sounds of the bass violin. Daniel
took out his pencil, and began writing notes on the table. Eleanore
bent over, looking at him, and, like him, fell to dreamy thinking.</p>

<p>Neither wished to know what the other was thinking; they entertained
themselves in silence; inwardly they were drawn closer and
closer together, as if by some mysterious and irresistible power.
They had not noticed that it was evening, that the room was empty,
that the waiters had taken the glasses away, and that the dance
music in the room above had stopped.</p>

<p>They sat there in the half-lighted corner side by side, as if in
some dark, deserted cavern. When they finally came out of their
deep silence and looked at each other, they were first surprised
and then dismayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we going to do?&#8221; asked Eleanore half in a whisper,
&#8220;it is late; we must be going home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sky was clouded, a warm wind swept across the plains, the
road was full of puddles. Here and there a light flashed from the
darkness, and a dog barked every now and then in the distant
villages. When the road turned into the forest, Daniel gave
Eleanore his arm. She took it, but soon let go. Daniel stopped,
and said almost angrily: &#8220;Are we bewitched, both of us? Speak,
Eleanore, speak!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there for me to say?&#8221; she asked gently. &#8220;I am frightened;
it is so dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are frightened, Eleanore, you? You do not know the
night. It has never yet been night in your soul; nor night in the
world about you. Now you appreciate perhaps how a being of the
night feels.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me your hand,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will lead you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him her hand. Soon they saw the lights of the city.
He took her to her house; but when they reached it, they did not
say good-bye: they looked at each other with dazed, helpless,
seeking eyes; they were both pale and speechless.</p>

<p>Eleanore hastened into the hall, but turned as she reached the
stairs, and waved to him with a smile, as if the two were separated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>by a hazy distance. As he fixed his eyes on the spot where he
saw the slender figure disappear, he felt as if something were
clutching his throat.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Without the slightest regard for time, without feeling tired,
without definite thoughts, detached from the present and all sense
of obligation, Daniel wandered aimlessly through the streets. A
low dive on Sch&uuml;tt Island saw him as a late guest. He sat there
with his hands before his eyes, neither seeing nor hearing nor
feeling, all crouched up in a bundle. Dirty little puddles of gin
glistened on the top of the table, the gamblers were cursing, the
proprietor was drunk.</p>

<p>The fire alarm drove him out: there was a fire in the suburbs
of Schoppershof. The sky was reddened, it was drizzling. It
seemed to Daniel that the air was reeking with the premonition
of a heart-crushing disaster. Above the Laufer Gate a sheaf of
sparks was whirling about.</p>

<p>Just then the melody for which he had waited so long throughout
so many nights of restless despair arose before him in a
grandiose circle. It seemed as if born for the words of the
&#8220;Harzreise&#8221;: &#8220;With the dim burning torch thou lightest for him
the ferries at night over bottomless paths, across desolate fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>In mournful thirds, receding again and again, the voices sank
to earth; just one remained on high, alone, piously dissociated
from profane return.</p>

<p>He hummed the melody with trembling lips to himself, until
he met the nineteenth-century Socrates with his followers in the
Rosenthal. They were still gipsying through the night.</p>

<p>They all talked at once; they were going to the fire. Daniel
passed by unrecognised. The shrill voice of the painter Kropotkin
pierced the air: &#8220;Hail to the flames! Hail to those whose coming
we announce!&#8221; The laughter of the slough brothers died away
in the distance.</p>

<p>Gertrude was standing at the head of the stairs with a candle
in her hand; she had been waiting there since twelve o&#8217;clock. At
eleven she had gone over to her father&#8217;s house and rung the bell.
Eleanore, frightened, had raised the window, and called down to
her that Daniel had left her at nine.</p>

<p>He took the half-inanimate woman into the living room: &#8220;You
must never wait for me, never,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p><p>He opened the window, pointed to the glowing sky beyond the
church, and as she leaned her head, with eyes closed, on his
shoulder, he said with a scurrilous distortion of his face: &#8220;Behold!
The fire! Hail to the flames! Hail to those whose coming we
announce!&#8221;</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The following morning Eleanore had no time to think of why
Daniel had not gone home.</p>

<p>Jordan had just finished his breakfast when some one rang the
door bell with unusual rapidity. Eleanore went to the door, and
came back with Herr Zittel, who was in a rare state of excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to inquire about your son, Jordan,&#8221; he began,
clearing his throat as though he were embarrassed.</p>

<p>&#8220;About my son?&#8221; replied Jordan astonished, &#8220;I thought you had
given him three days&#8217; leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing about that,&#8221; replied Herr Zittel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last Saturday evening he went on a visit to his friend Gerber
in Bamberg to celebrate the founding of a club, or something of
that sort; we are not expecting him until to-morrow. If you
know nothing about this arrangement, Herr Diruf must have given
him his leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief of the clerical department bit his lips. &#8220;Can you
give me the address of this Herr Gerber?&#8221; he asked, &#8220;I should
like to send him a telegram.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake, what has happened, Herr Zittel?&#8221; cried
Jordan, turning pale.</p>

<p>Herr Zittel stared into space with his gloomy, greenish eyes:
&#8220;On Saturday afternoon Herr Diruf gave your son a cheque for
three thousand seven hundred marks, and told him to cash it at
the branch of the Bavarian Bank and bring the money to me. I
was busy and did not go to the office in the afternoon. To-day,
about a half-hour ago, Herr Diruf asked me whether I had
received the money. It turned out that your son had not put in
his appearance on Saturday, and since he has not shown up this
morning either, you will readily see why we are so uneasy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jordan straightened up as stiff as a flag pole: &#8220;Do you mean to
insinuate that my son is guilty of some criminal transaction?&#8221; he
thundered forth, and struck the top of the table with the bones
of his clenched fist.</p>

<p>Herr Zittel shrugged his shoulders: &#8220;It is, of course, possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>that there has been some misunderstanding, or that some one has
failed to perform his duty. But in any event the affair is serious.
Something must be done at once, and if you leave me in the lurch
I shall have to call in the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jordan&#8217;s face turned ashen pale. For some reason or other he
began to fumble about in his long black coat for the pocket. The
coat had no pocket, and yet he continued to feel for it with hasty
fingers. He tried to speak, but his tongue refused to obey him;
beads of perspiration settled on his brow.</p>

<p>Eleanore embraced him with solicitous affection: &#8220;Be calm,
Father, don&#8217;t imagine the worst. Sit down, and let us talk it
over.&#8221; She dried the perspiration from his forehead with her
handkerchief, and then breathed a kiss on it.</p>

<p>Jordan fell on a chair; his powers of resistance were gone; he
looked at Eleanore with beseeching tenseness. From the very first
she had known what had happened and what would happen. But
she dared not show him that she was without hope; she summoned
all the power at her resourceful command to prevent the old man
from having a paralytic stroke.</p>

<p>With the help of Herr Zittel she wrote out a telegram to
Gerber. The answer, to be pre-paid, was to be sent to the General
Agency of the Prudentia, and Eleanore was to go to the main office
between eleven and twelve o&#8217;clock. She accompanied Herr Zittel
to the front door, whereupon he said: &#8220;Do everything in your
power to get the money. If the loss can be made good at once,
Herr Diruf may be willing not to take the case to the courts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore knew full well that it would be exceedingly difficult
to get such a sum as this. Her father had no money in the bank;
his employer had lost confidence in him because he could no
longer exert himself; what he needed most of all was a rest.</p>

<p>She entered the room with a friendly expression on her face,
and remarked quite vivaciously: &#8220;Now, Father, we will wait and
see what Benno has to say; and in order that you may not worry
so much, I will read something nice to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sitting on a hassock at her father&#8217;s feet she read from a recent
number of the <i>Gartenlaube</i> the description of an ascent of Mont
Blanc. Then she read another article that her eye chanced to fall
upon. All the while her bright voice was ringing through the
room, she was struggling with decisions to which she might come
and listening to the ticking of the clock. That her father no
more had his mind on what she was reading than she herself was
perfectly clear to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p><p>Finally the clock struck eleven. She got up, and said she had
to go to the kitchen to make the fire. A maid usually came in at
eleven to get dinner for the family, but to-day she had not
appeared. Out in the hall Eleanore took her straw hat, and
hastened over to Gertrude&#8217;s as fast as her feet could carry her.
Daniel was not at home; Gertrude was peeling potatoes.</p>

<p>In three sentences Eleanore had told her sister the whole story.
&#8220;Now you come with me at once! Go up and stay with Father!
See that he does not leave the house! I will be back in half
an hour!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude was literally dragged down the steps by Eleanore;
before she could ask questions of any kind, Eleanore had disappeared.</p>

<p>At the General Agency Herr Zittel met her with the reply from
that Gerber, Benno&#8217;s friend. It bore Gerber&#8217;s signature, and
read: &#8220;Benno Jordan has not been here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin Dorn stood behind Herr Zittel; he displayed an
expression of soft, smooth, dirge-like regret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Diruf would like to speak to you,&#8221; said Herr Zittel
coldly.</p>

<p>Eleanore entered Herr Diruf&#8217;s private office; her face was pale.
He kept on writing for about three minutes before he took any
notice of her. Then his plum-like eyes opened lazily, a rare,
voluptuous smile sneaked out from under his moustache like a slothful
flash of heat lightning; he said: &#8220;The sharper has gone and
done it, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore never moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can the embezzled money be returned within twenty-four
hours?&#8221; asked the pudgy, purple prince of pen-pushers.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father will do everything that is humanly possible,&#8221; replied
Eleanore anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be so good as to inform your father that to-morrow morning
at twelve o&#8217;clock the charge will be preferred and placed in the
hands of the police, if the money has not been paid by that
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore hastened home. Now her father had to be brought
face to face with the realities of the case. He and Gertrude were
sitting close to each other in terrible silence. Eleanore revealed
the exact state of affairs; she had to.</p>

<p>&#8220;My good name!&#8221; groaned Jordan.</p>

<p>He had to save himself from disgrace; the twenty-four hours
seemed to offer him a sure means of doing this. He had not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>remotest doubt but that he could find friends who would come
to his aid; for he had something of which he could boast: a
blameless past and the reputation of being a reliable citizen.</p>

<p>Thus he thought it over to himself. And as soon as he made
up his mind to appeal to the friends of whom he felt he was
certain, the most difficult part of his plan seemed to have been
completed. The suffering to which he was condemned by his
wounded pride and his betrayed, crushed filial affection he had to
bear alone. He knew that this was a separate item.</p>

<p>He went out to look up his friends.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The first one he appealed to was the brother-in-law of his sister,
First Lieutenant Kupferschmied, retired. His sister had died six
months ago, leaving nothing; the lieutenant, however, was a well-to-do
man. He had married into the family of a rich merchant.
Jordan&#8217;s relation to him had always been pleasant; indeed the old
soldier seemed to be very fond of him. But hardly had Jordan
explained his mission when the lieutenant became highly excited.
He said he had seen this disaster coming. He remarked that any
man who brings up his children in excessive ease must not be surprised
if they come to a bad end. He remarked, too, that no power
on earth could persuade him to invest one penny in Jordan&#8217;s case.</p>

<p>Jordan went away speechless.</p>

<p>The second friend he appealed to was his acquaintance of long
standing, Judge R&uuml;bsam. From him he heard a voluble flow of
words dealing with regrets, expressions of disgust, one lament after
the other, a jeremiade on hard times, maledictions hurled at dilatory
creditors, infinite consolation&mdash;and empty advice. He assured
Jordan that yesterday he had almost the requisite sum in cash, and
that he might have it again some time next month, but to-day&mdash;ah,
to-day his taxes were due, and so on, and so on.</p>

<p>Oppressed by the weight of this unexpected humiliation, he
went to the third friend, a merchant by the name of Hornbusch,
to whom he had once rendered invaluable assistance. Herr Hornbusch
had forgotten all about this, though he had not forgotten
that he had vainly sounded in Jordan&#8217;s ears a warning against the
ever-increasing flippancy of young Benno. He told Jordan that
he himself was just then in urgent need of money, that he had
only last month been obliged to sacrifice a mortgage, and that his
wife had pawned her diamonds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p><p>Thus it went with the fourth friend, an architect who had told
him once that he would sacrifice money and reputation for him if
he ever got into trouble. And it was the same story with the fifth
and sixth and seventh. With a heart as heavy as lead, Jordan
decided to take the last desperate step: He went to Herr Diruf
himself. He asked for a three days&#8217; extension of time. Diruf
sat inapproachable at his desk. He was smoking a big thick Havana
cigar, his solitaire threw off its blinding fireworks, he smiled a
cold, tired smile and shook his head in astonishment.</p>

<p>When Jordan came home that evening he found Daniel and
Gertrude in the living room. Gertrude went up to him to support
him; then she brought him a glass of wine as a stimulant:
he had not eaten anything since breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Eleanore?&#8221; he murmured, but seemed to take no
interest in the reply to his question. He fell down on a chair,
and buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Gertrude, who saw his strength leaving him as the light dies out
of a slowly melting candle, became dizzy with compassion. Her
last hope was in Eleanore, who had left at five o&#8217;clock simply
because she found it intolerable to sit around, hour after hour,
doing nothing but waiting for the return of her father. At every
sound that could be heard in the house, Gertrude pricked up her
ears in eager expectancy.</p>

<p>Daniel stood by the window, and looked out across the deserted
square into the dull red glow of the setting sun.</p>

<p>It struck seven, then half past seven, eight, and Eleanore had not
returned. Daniel began to pace back and forth through the room;
he was nervous. If his foot chanced to strike against a chair,
Gertrude shuddered.</p>

<p>Shortly after eight, steps were heard outside. The key rattled
in the front gate, the room door opened, and in came Eleanore&mdash;and
Philippina Schimmelweis.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Everybody looked at Philippina; even Jordan himself honoured
her with a faint glance. Daniel and Gertrude were amazed.
Daniel did not recognise his cousin; he knew nothing about her;
he had seen her but once, and then he was a mere child. He did
not know who this repulsive-looking individual was, and demanded
that Eleanore give him an explanation. As he did this, he raised
his eyebrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p><p>Eleanore was the only one Philippina looked at in a kindly way;
in Philippina&#8217;s own face there was an expression of curiosity.</p>

<p>Philippina&#8217;s whole bearing had something of the monstrous about
it. Even her dress was picturesque, adventuresome. Her great
brown straw hat, with the ribbon sticking straight up in the air,
was shoved on to the back of her head so as not to spoil the effect
of the fashionable bangs that hung down over her forehead. Her
loud, checkered dress was strapped about her waist with a cloth
belt so tightly that the contour of her fat body was made to look
positively ridiculous: she resembled a gigantic hour glass. In her
rough-cut features there was an element of lurking malevolence.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of painful stillness she walked up to Daniel,
and plucked him by the coat-sleeve: &#8220;Eh, you don&#8217;t know who I
am?&#8221; she asked, and her squinty eyes shone on him with enigmatic
savagery: &#8220;I am Philippina; you know, Philippina Schimmelweis.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel stepped back from her: &#8220;Well, what of it?&#8221; he asked,
wrinkling his brow.</p>

<p>She followed him, took him by the coat-sleeve again, and led
him over into one corner: &#8220;Listen, Daniel,&#8221; she stammered, &#8220;my
father&mdash;he must give you all the money you need. For years ago
your father gave him all the money he had, and told him to keep
it for you. Do you understand? I happened to hear about it
one time when my father was talking about it to my mother. It
was a good seven years ago, but I made a note of it. My father
spent the money on himself; he thinks he can keep it. Go to him,
and tell him what you want; tell him how much you want, and
then go help these people here. But you must not give me away;
if you do they&#8217;ll kill me. Do you understand? You won&#8217;t say
a word about it, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that true?&#8221; Daniel managed to say in reply, as a feeling of
unspeakable anger struggled with one of indescribable disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true, Daniel, every word of it; &#8217;pon my soul and honour,&#8221;
replied Philippina; &#8220;just go, and you&#8217;ll see that I have told you
the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the conversation of the two, of which she could hardly
hear a single syllable, Eleanore never took her eyes off them.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Since the day Philippina had made her little brother Markus a
cripple for life, she had been an outcast in the home of her parents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p><p>To be sure, she had had no great abundance of kindness and
cheerfulness before the accident took place. But since that time
the barbarous castigation of her father had beclouded and besmirched
her very soul. From her twelfth year on, her mind was
ruled exclusively by hate.</p>

<p>Hatred aroused her; it gave birth to thoughts and plans in her;
it endowed her with strength of will and audacity; and it matured
her before her time.</p>

<p>She hated her father, her mother, her brothers.</p>

<p>She hated the house with all its rooms; she hated the bed in
which she slept, the table at which she ate. She hated the people
who came to see her parents, the customers who came into the shop,
the loafers who gathered about the window, the tall lanky
Zwanziger, the books and the magazines.</p>

<p>But the day she overheard her father and mother talking about
that money, a second power had joined the ranks of hate in her
benighted, abandoned soul. With her brain on fire she stood
behind the door, and heard that she was to be married to Daniel.
This remark had filled the then thirteen-year-old girl with all the
savage instincts of a bound and fettered woman, with all the
crabbedness of an unimaginative person of her standing.</p>

<p>In her father&#8217;s remark she did not see merely a more or less
carefully outlined plan; she heard a message from Fate itself; and
from that time on she lived with an idea that brought light and
purpose into her daily existence.</p>

<p>Shortly after his arrival in Nuremberg, she saw Daniel for the
first time as he was standing by a booth in the market place on
Sch&uuml;tt Island. Her father had pointed him out to her. She
knew that he wished to become a musician; this made no special
impression on her. She knew that he was having a hard time of
it; this filled her neither with sympathy nor regret. When she
later on saw him in the concert hall, he was already her promised
spouse; he belonged to her. To capture him, to get him into her
power, it made no difference how, was her unchanging aspiration,
in which there was a bizarre mixture of bestiality and insanity.</p>

<p>The thieving, which she decided upon at once and practised
with perfect regularity, netted her in the course of time a handsome
sum. She did not become bolder and bolder as she continued
her evil practices, but, unlike thieves generally, she grew to be
more and more cautious. She acquired in time remarkable skill
at showing an outwardly honest face. Indeed she became such an
adept at dissimulation that the suspicion of even Jason Philip,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>aroused as it had been during the course of a careful investigation,
was dispelled by her behaviour.</p>

<p>Her plan was to gain a goodly measure of independence through
the money she had stolen. For she always felt convinced that the
day would come when her parents would debar her from their
home. She was convinced that her father and mother were merely
waiting for some plausible excuse to rid themselves of her for
good and all.</p>

<p>Moreover, she had two pronounced passions: one for candy and
one for flashy ribbons.</p>

<p>The candy she always bought in the evening. She would slip
into the shop of Herr Degen, and, with her greedy eyes opened
as wide as possible, buy twenty pfennigs&#8217; worth of sweets, at which
she would nibble until she went to bed.</p>

<p>The ribbons she sewed together into sashes, which she wore on
her hat or around her neck or on her dress. The gaudier the
colour the better she liked it. If her mother asked her where
she got the ribbons she was forced to lie. Although she had no
girl friends, as a matter of fact no friends of any kind, she would
say that this or that girl had given them to her. When her wealth
became too conspicuous, she would leave the house and not tie her
sashes about her until she had reached some unlighted gateway
or dark corner.</p>

<p>She never dared go to the attic more than once a week; she did
this when her brothers were at school and her parents in the shop.
The fear lest some one find her out and take her stolen riches from
her made her more and more uneasy, lending to her face an expression
of virulent distrust.</p>

<p>She would go up the thirteen steps from the landing to the
attic with trembling feet. The fact that there were exactly thirteen
was the first thing that awakened her superstition. As the
months crept on, she resigned to this superstition with the abandon
of an inveterate voluptuary. If she chanced to put her left foot
first on the bottom step and not to notice it until she was half way
up, she would turn around, come down, and relinquish the pleasure
of seeing her treasures for the rest of that week.</p>

<p>She was afraid of ghosts, witches, and magicians; if a cat ran
across the street in front of her, she turned as white as chalk.</p>

<p>Theresa did not keep a maid; Philippina helped in the kitchen;
this ruined her complexion, and made her skin rough and horny.
Frequently she got out of washing dishes by simply running away.
On these occasions Theresa would create such an uproar that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>the neighbours would come to the window and look out. Philippina
avenged herself by purposely ruining the sheets, towels, and
shirts that lay in the clothes basket. When in this mood and at
this business, she made use of a regular oath that she herself had
formulated: it consisted of sentences that sounded most impressive,
though they had no meaning.</p>

<p>She cherished the odd delusion that it lay in her power to bring
misfortune to other people. The time Jason Philip complained
of poor business she felt an infernal sense of satisfaction. His
change of political views had driven away his old customers, and
the new ones had no confidence in him. He had to go in for the
publication of dubious works, if he wished to do any business at
all. The result of this was that when people passed by the Schimmelweis
bookshop, they stopped before the window, looked at his
latest output, and smiled contemptuously. The workman&#8217;s insurance
no longer paid as it used to, for the credit of the Prudentia
and its agents had suffered a violent setback.</p>

<p>The rise and fall in bourgeois life follows a well established
law. In a single day the honesty and diligence of one man, the
tricks and frauds of another, grow stale, antiquated. Thus Jordan&#8217;s
affairs started on the down grade, and Jason Philip&#8217;s likewise.</p>

<p>Philippina ascribed their failure to the quiet influence of her
destructive work. Every bit of misfortune in the life of her
father loosened by that much the chain that prevented her from
complete freedom of movement. In her most infamous hours she
would dream of the hunger and distress, bankruptcy and despair
of her people. Once this state of affairs had been realised, she
would no longer have to play the r&ocirc;le of Cinderella; she would
no longer have to be the first one up in the morning; she would
no longer have to chop wood, and polish her brothers&#8217; boots: she
would have a fair field and no favours in her campaign to capture
Daniel.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>At times she thought she could simply go to him and stay with
him. At times she felt that he would come and get her. One
thing or the other had to take place, she thought.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon&mdash;it chanced to be her eighteenth birthday&mdash;a
junior agent of Jason Philip, a fellow by the name of
Pfefferkorn, came to the house, and in the course of the conversation
remarked rather casually that the elder of the Jordan sisters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
was engaged to the musician Nothafft, that the engagement had
been kept secret for a while, but that the wedding was to take
place in the immediate future.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, I hear that the musician is your nephew,&#8221; said
Pfefferkorn at the close of his report.</p>

<p>Jason Philip cast a gloomy look into space, while Theresa, then
sipping her chicory coffee, set her cup on the table, and looked at
the man with scornful contempt.</p>

<p>Philippina broke out in a laughter that went through them like
a knife. Then she ran from the room, and banged the door
behind her. &#8220;She seems a bit deranged,&#8221; murmured Jason Philip
angrily.</p>

<p>Then came that June night on which she did not come home at
all. Jason Philip raged and howled when she returned the next
morning; but she was silent. He locked her up in the cellar for
sixteen hours; but she was silent.</p>

<p>After this she did not leave the house for months at a time;
she did not wash or comb her hair; she sat crouched up in the
kitchen with her long, dishevelled, unwashed hair falling in loose
locks down over her neck and shoulders.</p>

<p>A feeling of consuming vengeance seethed in her heart; the
patience she was forced to practise, much against her will, petrified
in time into a mien of hypocritic sottishness.</p>

<p>Suddenly she took to dressing up again and sauntering through
the streets in the afternoon. Her loud ribbons awakened the
mocking laughter of young and old.</p>

<p>She had learned that Eleanore Jordan was attending the lectures
in the Cultural Club. She went too; she always crowded up close
to Eleanore, but she could not attract her attention. One time
she sat right next to Eleanore. A strolling pastor delivered a
lecture on cremation. Philippina took out her handkerchief, and
pressed it to her eyes as though she were weeping. Eleanore,
somewhat concerned, turned to her, and asked her what was the
matter. She said that it was all so sad what the old gentleman was
saying. Eleanore was surprised, for nothing the speaker had said
was sad or in any way likely to bring tears to the eyes of his
auditors.</p>

<p>At the end of the lecture she left the hall with Eleanore. When
the ugly, disagreeable creature told her of the wretchedness of her
life, how she was abused by her parents and brothers, and that
there was not a soul in the world who cared for her, Eleanore was
moved. The fact that Philippina was Daniel&#8217;s blood cousin made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>her forget the aversion she felt, and drew from her a promise to
go walking with her on certain days.</p>

<p>Eleanore kept her promise. She was not in the least disconcerted
by the queer looks cast at her by the people they met. With perfect
composure she walked along by the side of this strapping, quackish
young woman dressed in the oddest garments known to the art
of dress-making. At first they strolled in broad daylight through
the park adjoining the city moat. Later Eleanore arranged to
have the walks, which were to take place two or three times a
month, postponed until after sunset.</p>

<p>This was quite agreeable to Philippina. She threw out a hint
every now and then that there was a mysterious feud between the
Schimmelweis family and the Nothaffts, and implored Eleanore
never to let Daniel know that she was taking these walks with her.
It was painful to Eleanore to have Philippina make such requests
of her. The lurking manner in which she would turn the conversation
to the affairs of Daniel and Gertrude had an element of
offensive intrusiveness in it. She wanted to know first this, then
that. She even had the impudence to ask about Gertrude&#8217;s dowry;
and finally she requested that Eleanore bring her sister along some
time when they went walking.</p>

<p>Eleanore came to have a feeling of horror at the sight or thought
of Philippina; she was dismayed too when, despite the darkness,
she noticed the shrewish look of incorrigible wickedness in Philippina&#8217;s
face. An ineluctable voice put her on her guard. In so far
as she could do it without grievously offending Philippina, she
withdrew from further association with her. And even if she had
not promised her absolute silence, a feeling half of fear and half
of shame would have prevented her from ever mentioning Philippina&#8217;s
name in Daniel&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p>She never once suspected that Philippina was spying on her.
Philippina soon found out just when, how often, and where Daniel
and Eleanore met; and wherever they went, she followed at a safe
distance behind them. Why she did this she really did not know;
something forced her to do it.</p>

<p>What she had succeeded in doing with Eleanore she now wished
to do with Gertrude. She would bob up all of a sudden in the
butcher shop, at the vegetable market, in the dairy, anywhere, stare
at Gertrude, act as though she were intensely interested in something,
and make some such remarks as: &#8220;Lord, but beans are dear
this year&#8221;; or &#8220;That is a nasty wind, it is enough to give you
the colic.&#8221; But Gertrude was far too lost to the world and much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>too sensitive about coming in contact with strangers to pay any
attention to her awkward attempts at approach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just wait,&#8221; thought Philippina, enraged, &#8220;the penalty of your
arrogance will some day descend upon your head.&#8221;</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>On that Monday so fatal for the Jordan family, Philippina
had another violent quarrel with her mother. Theresa was still
shrieking, when Jason Philip came up from the shop to know what
could be wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask,&#8221; cried Theresa at the top of her shrill voice, &#8220;go
teach your daughter some manners. The wench is going to end
up in jail; that&#8217;s what I prophesy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina made a wry face. Jason Philip, however, was little
inclined to play the r&ocirc;le of an avenging power: he had something
new on the string; his face was beaming.</p>

<p>&#8220;I met Hornbusch,&#8221; he said, turning to Theresa, &#8220;you know
him, firm of Hornbusch heirs, bloody rich they are, and the man
tells me that young Jordan has embezzled some money from the
Prudentia and left the country. I went at once to the Prudentia,
and Zittel told me the whole story, just as I had heard it. It is
almost four thousand marks! Jordan has been requested to make
good the deficit; but he hasn&#8217;t a penny to his name and is in a
mighty tight place, for Diruf is threatening to send him to jail.
You know, Diruf is hard-boiled in matters of this kind. What do
you think of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Theresa wrapped her hands in her apron, and looked at Jason
Philip out of the corner of her eye. She guessed at once the
cause of his joy, and hung her head in silence.</p>

<p>Jason Philip smirked to himself. Leaning up against the Dutch
tiles of the stove, he began to whistle in a happy-go-lucky mood.
It was the &#8220;Marseillaise.&#8221; He whistled it partly out of forgetfulness
and partly from force of habit.</p>

<p>He had not noticed how Philippina had listened to every syllable
that fell from his lips; how she was holding her breath; that her
features were lighted up from within by a terrible flame of fire.
He did notice, however, that she got up at the close of his remarks
and left the room with rustling steps.</p>

<p>Five minutes later she was standing before Jordan&#8217;s house. She
sent a small boy in with the request that Fr&auml;ulein Eleanore come
down at once. The boy came back, and said that Fr&auml;ulein Eleanore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>was not at home. She took her position by the front gate, and
waited.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>Driven by the torment of her soul, Eleanore had gone to Martha
R&uuml;bsam&#8217;s only to hear that her father had been there three hours
earlier. From the confused and embarrassed conduct of her friend
she learned that her father had made a request of Judge R&uuml;bsam,
and a fruitless one at that.</p>

<p>Then she stood for a while on one of the leading streets, and
stared in bewilderment at the throngs of people surging by. It
was all so cruelly real.</p>

<p>She thought of whom she might go to next. A wave of purple
flashed across her face as she thought of Eberhard. Involuntarily she
made a passionate, deprecating gesture, as if she were saying: No,
no, not to him! The first ray of this hope was also the last. Her
conscience struck her; but she was helpless. Here was a feeling
impervious to reason; armed ten times over against encouragement.
Anyhow, he was not at home. She thought of this with a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>Would Daniel go to the Baroness? No; that could not be
thought of for a minute.</p>

<p>She could no longer endure the city nor the people in it. She
walked through the park out into the country. She could not stand
the sight of the sky or the distant views; she turned around. She
came back to The F&uuml;ll, entered the Carovius house, and rang Frau
Benda&#8217;s bell. She knew the old lady was away, and yet, as if
quite beside herself, she rang four times. If Benda would only
come; if the good friend were only sitting in his room and could
come to the door.</p>

<p>But there was not a stir. From the first floor the sounds of a
piano floated out the window; it was being played in full chords.
Down in the court C&aelig;sar was howling.</p>

<p>She started back home with beating heart. At the front gate
she saw Philippina.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard all about your misfortune,&#8221; said Philippina in
her shrill voice. &#8220;Nobody can help you but me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You? You can help?&#8221; stammered Eleanore. The whole
square began to move, it seemed, before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Word of honour&mdash;I can. I must simply have a talk with Daniel
first. Let&#8217;s lose no time. Is he upstairs?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;I think he is. If not, I will get him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go up, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went up the stairs.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>Jason Philip had been invited to a sociable evening in the
Shufflers&#8217; Club. He was now enjoying his siesta after his banquet
by reading an editorial in the <i>Kurier</i>. One of Bismarck&#8217;s addresses
had been so humorously commented on that every now and then
Jason Philip emitted a malevolent snarl of applause.</p>

<p>He had brought a lemon along home with him; it was lying on
a plate before him, sliced and covered with sugar. From time to
time he would reach over, take a piece and stick it in his mouth.
He smacked his tongue with the display of much ceremony of his
kind, and licked his lips after swallowing a piece. His two sons
gaped at his hand with greedy eyes and likewise licked their
lips.</p>

<p>Willibald was groaning over an algebraic equation. In his pale,
pimpled face were traces of incapability and bad humour. Markus,
owing to his physical defect, was not allowed to study by artificial
light. He helped his mother shell the peas, and in order to make
her angry at Philippina, kept making mean remarks about her staying
out so long.</p>

<p>Just as the last piece of the lemon disappeared behind Jason
Philip&#8217;s moustache, the door bell rang.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a man out there,&#8221; said Markus, who had gone to the
door and was now standing on the threshold, stupidly staring with
his one remaining eye.</p>

<p>Jason Philip stretched his neck. Then he got up. He had
recognised Daniel standing in the half-lighted hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have something to say to you,&#8221; said Daniel, as he entered the
room. His eyes gazed on the walls and at the few cheap, ugly,
banal objects that hung on them: a newspaper-holder with embroidered
ribbons; a corner table on which stood a beer mug representing
the fat body of a monk; an old chromic print showing a volunteer
taking leave of his big family as he starts for the front. These
things appealed to Daniel somewhat as an irrational dream. Then,
taking a deep breath, he fixed his eyes on Jason Philip. In his
mind&#8217;s eye he looked back over many years; he saw himself standing
at the fountain in Eschenbach. Round about him glistened the
stones and cross beams of the houses. Jason Philip was hurrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>by at a timid distance. There was bitterness in his face: he seemed
to be fleeing from the world, the sun, men, and music.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have something to say to you,&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>Theresa felt that the worst of her forebodings were about to be
fulfilled. With trembling knees she arose. She did not dare
turn her eyes toward the place in the room where Daniel was
standing. She did not see, she merely sensed Jason Philip as
he beckoned to her and his sons to leave the room. She took
Markus by the hand and Willibald by the coat-sleeve, and marched
out between the two.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the news?&#8221; asked Jason Philip, as he crossed his arms
and looked at the pile of beans on the table. &#8220;You have a&mdash;what
shall I say?&mdash;a very impulsive way about you. It is a way that
reminds me of the fact that we have a law in this country against
disturbing the peace of a private family. Your stocks must have
gone to the very top of the market recently. Well, tell me, what
do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>He cleared his throat, and beat a tattoo on the elbows of his
crossed arms with his fingers.</p>

<p>Daniel felt that his peace was leaving him; his own arm seemed
to him like a shot-gun; it itched. But thus far he could not say
a thing. The question he had in mind to put to Jason Philip was
of such tremendous import that he could not suppress his fear that
he might make a mistake or become too hasty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the money my father gave you?&#8221; came the words at
last, rolling from his lips in a tone of muffled sullenness.</p>

<p>The colour left Jason Philip&#8217;s face; his arms fell down by
his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;The money? Where it&#8217;s gone to? That your father&mdash;?&#8221;
He stuttered in confusion. He wanted to gain time; he wanted
to think over very carefully what he should say and what he could
conceal. He cast one glance at Daniel, and saw that it was not
possible to expect mercy from him. He was afraid of Daniel&#8217;s
bold, lean, sinewy face.</p>

<p>He nearly burst with anger at the thought that this young man,
for whom he, Jason Philip, was once the highest authority, should
have the unmitigated audacity to call him to account. In this
whole situation he pictured himself as the immaculate man of
honour that he wished he was and thought he was in the eyes of
his fellow citizens. At the same time he was nearly stifled with
fear lest he lose the money which he had long since accustomed
himself to regard as his own, with which he had worked and speculated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>and which by this time was as much a part of his very
being as his own house, his business, his projects. He buried his
hands in his pockets and snorted. His cowardly dread of the consequences
of fraud forced him into a half confession of fraud,
but in his words lay the feverish pettifogging of the frenzied
financier who fights for Mammon even unto raging and despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;The money is here; of course it is. Where did you think it
was? My books will show exactly how much of it has found its
way over to Eschenbach in the shape of interest and loans. My
books are open to inspection; the accounts have been kept right
up to this very day. I have made considerable progress in life. A
man who has lived as I have lived does not need to fear a living
soul. Do you imagine for a minute that Jason Philip Schimmelweis
can be frightened by a little thing like this? No, no, it
will take more of a man than you to do that. Who are you
anyhow? What office do you hold? What authority have you?
With what right do you come rushing into the four walls of my
home? Do you perhaps imagine that your artistic skill invests you
with special privileges? I don&#8217;t give a tinker&#8217;s damn for your art.
The whole rubbish is hardly worth spitting on. Music? Idiocy.
Who needs it? Any man with the least vestige of self-respect
never has anything to do with music except on holidays and when
the day&#8217;s work is done. No, no, you can&#8217;t impress me with your
music. You&#8217;re not quite sane! And if you think that you are
going to get any money out of me, you are making the mistake
of your life. It is to laugh. If a man wants money from me,
he has to come to me at least with a decent hair-cut and show
me at least a little respect. He can&#8217;t come running up like a kid
on the street who says: &#8216;Mumma, gif me a shent; I want to buy
some tandy.&#8217; No, no, son, you can&#8217;t get anything out of me
that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smile that appeared on Daniel&#8217;s face filled Jason Philip with
mortal terror. He stopped his talk with incriminating suddenness.
He decided to hold in and to promise Daniel a small payment.
He hoped that by handing over a few hundred marks he could
assure himself the desired peace of mind.</p>

<p>But Daniel never felt so certain of himself in his life. He
thought of the hardships he had had to endure, and his heart
seemed as if it were on fire. At the same time he was ashamed of
this man and disgusted with him.</p>

<p>He said quietly and firmly: &#8220;I must have three thousand seven
hundred marks by ten o&#8217;clock to-morrow morning. It is a question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>of saving an honourable and upright family from ruin. If this
sum is handed over to me promptly, I will waive all rights to the
balance that is due me, in writing. The receipt will be filled out
ready for delivery in my house. If the money is not in my
hands by the stipulated time, we will meet each other in another
place and in the presence of people who will impress you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to go.</p>

<p>Jason Philip&#8217;s mouth opened wide, and he pressed his fist to the
hole made thereby. &#8220;Three thousand seven hundred marks?&#8221; he
roared. &#8220;The man is crazy. Completely crazy is the man. Man,
man, you&#8217;re crazy,&#8221; he cried in order to get Daniel to stop. &#8220;Are
you crazy, man? Do you want to ruin me? Don&#8217;t you hear,
you damned man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel looked at Jason Philip with a shudder. The door to
the adjoining room sprang open, and Theresa rushed in. Her face
was ashen pale; there were just two little round red spots on her
cheek bones. &#8220;You are going to get that money, Daniel,&#8221; she
howled hysterically, &#8220;or I am going to jump into the Pegnitz,
I&#8217;ll jump into the Pegnitz and drown myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Woman, you&nbsp;...&#8221; he gnashed his teeth, and seized her by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>She sank down on a chair, and, seizing her hair, continued:
&#8220;He is everywhere, and wherever he is, our dear Gottfried, he is
looking at me. He stands before the clothes press, at the cupboard,
by my bedside, nods, exhorts, raises his finger, finds no
peace in his grave, and does not let me sleep; he has not let me
sleep all these years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now listen, you had better think of your children,&#8221; snapped
Jason Philip.</p>

<p>Theresa let her hands fall in her lap, and looked down at the
floor: &#8220;All that nice money, that nice money,&#8221; she cried. Then
again, this time with a face distorted beyond easy recognition and
at the top of her voice: &#8220;But you&#8217;ll get it, Daniel; I&#8217;ll see to it
that you get it: I&#8217;ll bring it to you myself.&#8221; Then again, in a
gentle voice of acute lamentation: &#8220;All that nice money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel was almost convulsed. It seemed to him as if he had
never rightly understood the word <i>money</i> before, as if the meaning
of <i>money</i> had never been made clear to him until he heard
Theresa say it.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow morning at ten o&#8217;clock,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Theresa nodded her head in silence, and raised her hands with
outstretched fingers as if to protect herself from Jason Philip.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>Willibald and Markus had crept under the door. The gate must
not have been closed, for just then Philippina came in. She had
come over with Daniel, but had remained outside on the street.
She could not wait any longer; she was too anxious to see the
consequences of her betrayal.</p>

<p>She looked around with affected embarrassment. Was it merely
the sight of her that aroused Jason Philip&#8217;s wrath? Was it the
half-cowardly, half-cynical smile that played around her lips? Or
was it the cumulative effect of blind anger, long pent up and eager
to be discharged, that made Jason Philip act as he did? Or did
he have a vague suspicion of what Philippina had done? Suffice
it to say, he leapt up to her and struck her in the face with
his fist.</p>

<p>She never moved a muscle.</p>

<p>Indignant at the rudeness of his conduct, Daniel stepped between
Jason Philip and his daughter. But the venomous scorn in the
girl&#8217;s eyes stifled his sympathy; he turned to the door, and went
away in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;All that nice money,&#8221; murmured Theresa.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>When Daniel told the Jordans that the money would be there
the next morning, Jordan looked at him first unbelievingly, and
then wept like a child.</p>

<p>Eleanore reached Daniel both her hands without saying a word.
Gertrude, who was lying on the sofa, straightened up, smiled
gently, and then lay down again. Daniel asked her what was the
matter. Eleanore answered for her, saying that she had not felt
well since some time in the afternoon. &#8220;She must go to bed, she
is tired,&#8221; added Eleanore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, come then,&#8221; said Daniel, and helped Gertrude to get
up. But her legs were without strength; she could not walk. She
looked first at Daniel and then at Eleanore; she was plainly worried
about something.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t care, will you, Father, if I go home with them?&#8221;
asked Eleanore in a tone of flattery.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, go, child,&#8221; said Jordan, &#8220;it will do me good to be alone
for a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel and Eleanore took Gertrude between them. At the second
landing in their apartment, Daniel took Gertrude in his
arms, and carried her into the bedroom. She did not want him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>to help her take off her clothes; she sent him out of the room.
A cup of warm milk was all she said she wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no milk there,&#8221; said Eleanore to Daniel, as she
entered the living room. He stopped suddenly, and looked at her
as if he had awakened from a fleeting dream: &#8220;I&#8217;ll run down to
Tetzel Street and get a half a litre,&#8221; said Eleanore. &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave
the hall door open, so that Gertrude will not be frightened when
I come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had already hastened out; but all of a sudden she turned
around, and said with joyful gratitude, her blue eyes swimming
in the tears of a full soul: &#8220;You dear man.&#8221;</p>

<p>His face took on a scowl.</p>

<p>There was a fearful regularity in his walking back and forth.
The chains of the hanging lamp shook. The flame sent forth a
thin column of smoke; he did not notice it. &#8220;How long will she
be gone?&#8221; he thought in his unconscious, drunken impatience.
He felt terribly deserted.</p>

<p>He stepped out into the hall, and listened. There hovered
before him in the darkness the face of Philippina. She showed
the same scornful immobility that she showed when her father
struck her in the face. He stepped to the railing, and sat down
on the top step; a fit at once of weakness and aimless defiance came
over him. He buried his face in his hands; he could still hear
Theresa saying, &#8220;All that nice money.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were shadows everywhere; there was nothing but night
and shadows.</p>

<p>Eleanore, light-hearted and light-footed, returned at last. When
she saw him, she stopped. He arose, and stretched out his arms
as if to take the milk bottle. That is the way she interpreted his
gesture, and handed it to him in surprise. He, however, set it
down on the landing beside him. The light from the living room
shone on it and made it look sparkling white. Then he drew
Eleanore to him, threw his arms around her, and kissed her on the
mouth.</p>

<p>Merely a creature of man, only a woman, nothing but heart and
breath, all longing and forgetting, forgetting for just one moment,
finding herself for a moment, knowing her own self for a moment&mdash;she
pressed close up to him. But her hands were folded between
her breast and his, and thus separated their bodies.</p>

<p>Then she broke away from him, wrung her hands, looked up at
him, pressed close up to him again, wrung her hands again&mdash;it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>all done in absolute silence and with an almost terrible grace and
loveliness.</p>

<p>Everything was now entirely different from what it had been,
or what she had formerly imagined it to be; there were depths to
everything now. She lost herself; she ceased to exist for a
moment; darkness enveloped her much-disciplined heart; she
entered upon a second existence, an existence that had no similarity
with the first.</p>

<p>To this existence she was now bound; she had succumbed to it:
the law of nature had gone into effect. But the glass case had
been shattered; it was in pieces. She stood there unprotected, even
exposed, so to speak, to men, no longer immune to their glances,
an accessible prey to their touch.</p>

<p>She went into the kitchen, and heated the milk. Daniel returned
to the living room. His veins were burning, his heart was
hammering. He had no sense of appreciation of the time that
had passed. When Eleanore came into the room, he began to
tremble.</p>

<p>She came up to him, and spoke to him in passionate sadness:
&#8220;Have you heard about Gertrude? Don&#8217;t you know, really? She
is with child&mdash;your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not know it,&#8221; whispered Daniel. &#8220;Did she tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, just now.&#8221;</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> habitu&eacute;s of the reserved table at the Crocodile were all
reasonably well informed of the events that had recently taken
place in the homes of Inspector Jordan and Jason Philip Schimmelweis.
Details were mentioned that would make it seem probable
that the cracks in the walls and the key-holes of both houses
had been entertaining eavesdroppers.</p>

<p>Some refused to believe that Jason Philip had made restitution
for the money young Jordan had embezzled. For, said Degen,
the baker, Schimmelweis is a hard-fisted fellow, and whoever
would try to get money out of him would have to be in the possession
of extraordinary shrewdness.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he has already paid it,&#8221; said Gr&uuml;ndlich, the watchmaker.
He knew he had; he knew that the wife of the bookseller had
gone over to Nothafft&#8217;s on Tuesday afternoon; that she had a heap
of silver in a bag; and that when she came back home she took to
bed, and had been ill ever since.</p>

<p>Kitzler, the assistant postmaster, felt there was something wrong
here; and if there was not, you would simply have to assume that
Nothafft, the musician, was a dangerous citizen, who had somehow
managed to place the breast of his uncle <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> a revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you know, Nothafft is to be made Kapellmeister at the
City Theatre,&#8221; remarked the editor Weibezahl, the latest member
of the round table. &#8220;His appointment is to be made public in a
few days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Kapellmeister! You don&#8217;t say so! That will make
Andreas D&ouml;derlein the saddest man in ten states.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herr Carovius, whose mouth was just then hanging on his beer
glass, laughed so heartily that the beer went down his Sunday
throat; he was seized with a coughing spell. Herr Korn slapped
him on the back.</p>

<p>It was a shame that such a bad actor as Nothafft had to be
endured in the midst of people who lived peaceful and law-abiding
lives. This lament came from Herr Kleinlein, who had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>circuit judge now for some time. He was anxious to know whether
all the tales that were circulating concerning Nothafft were true.</p>

<p>Well, he was told, a great many things are said about Nothafft,
but it is difficult to get at the truth. They appealed to the apothecary
Pflaum, on the ground that his assistant knew the musician
and might be able to give them some definite information.</p>

<p>Herr Pflaum took on an air as if he knew a great deal but was
under obligations not to tell. Yes, yes, he said rather perfunctorily,
he had heard that some one had said that Nothafft was running a
pretty questionable domestic establishment; that he had a rather
unsavoury past; and that there was some talk about his neglecting
his wife.</p>

<p>The deuce you say! Why, they were married only a short
while ago. Yes, but there was a rumour to the effect that there
was a woman in the case. Who could it be? Ahem! Well-ah,
it would be a good idea to be cautious about mentioning names.
Good Lord, why cautious? Why not straight out with the information
any one chanced to be fortunate enough to have? Is it not
a question of protecting one&#8217;s own wife and daughters?</p>

<p>And so this slanderous babble rattled on. There was something
unfathomable in their hatred of the musician. They were
just as agreed on this point as they would have been if Daniel had
broken open their strong boxes, smashed their windows, and betrayed
their honour and dignity to public ridicule.</p>

<p>They did not know what they should do about him. They
passed by him as one would pass by a bomb that might or might
not explode.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>When Herr Carovius was alone, he picked up the paper, and
read the account of a mine explosion in Silesia. The number of
killed satisfied him. The description of the women as they stood
at the top of the shaft, wept, wrung their hands, and called out
the names of their husbands, filled him with the same agreeable
sensation that he experienced when he listened to the melancholy
finale of a Chopin nocturne.</p>

<p>But he could not forget the expression on Herr Pflaum&#8217;s face
when he told how Nothafft was neglecting his wife. It had been
the expression that comes out, so to speak, from between the curtains
of a sleeping room: something was up, make no mistake, something
was going on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p><p>For quite a while Herr Carovius had harboured the suspicion
that there was something wrong. Twice he had met Daniel and
Eleanore walking along the street in the twilight, talking to each
other in a very mysterious way. Things were going on behind
Herr Carovius&#8217;s back which he could not afford to overlook.</p>

<p>Since the day Eleanore had disentangled the cord of his nose
glasses from the button of his top coat, the picture of the young
girl had been indelibly stamped on his mind. He could still see
the beautiful curvature of her young bosom as she raised her arm.</p>

<p>A year and a half after this incident, Herr Carovius was going
through some old papers. He chanced upon an unfinished letter
which Eberhard von Auffenberg had written to Eleanore but had
never posted. Eberhard had come to Nuremberg at the time to
transact some business connected with the negotiation of a new
loan; he had left his hotel, and Herr Carovius had had to wait
for him a long while. This time he had spent in looking over
the unsealed documents of the incautious young Baron.</p>

<p>Then it was that he discovered the letter. What words! And
oh, the passion! Herr Carovius would never have believed that
the reserved misanthrope was capable of such a display of emotion.
He felt that Eberhard had disclosed to him the most secret chambers
of his heart. He was terrified at the voluptuousness revealed
to him by the unveiling of the mystery of his soul. They are
human beings after all, those members of the nobility, he exclaimed
with a feeling of personal triumph. They throw themselves
away; they meet some slippery imp, and fall; they lose
control of themselves as soon as they hear a skirt rustle.</p>

<p>But what concerned the Baron in this case concerned also Herr
Carovius. A passion that had taken possession of the Baron had
to be guarded, studied, and eventually shared by Herr Carovius
himself.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius&#8217;s loneliness had gradually robbed him of his
equanimity. Suppressed impulses were stifling his mind with the
luxuriant growths of a vivid and vicious imagination. The adventures
into which he had voluntarily plunged in order to make sure
of his control over Eberhard had almost ruined him. The net
he had spread for the helplessly fluttering bird now held him
himself entangled in its meshes. The world to him was a body
full of wounds on which he was battening his Neronic lusts. But
it was at the same time a tapestry, with bright coloured pictures
which could be made living and real by a magic formula, and this
formula he had not yet been able to discover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p><p>At the insinuations of the apothecary his fancy took on new
life: he was not a man in whose soul old emotions died out; his
lusts never became extinct. Lying on the sofa, taking his midday
siesta, he would picture the figure of Eleanore dancing around
him in diminutive form. When he sat at the piano and played
an <i>&eacute;tude</i>, he imagined he saw Daniel standing beside him criticising
his technique&mdash;and doing it with much show of arrogance. When
he went out of evenings, he saw Nothafft displayed on all the
signs, while every <i>demi-monde</i> bore Eleanore&#8217;s features.</p>

<p>It seemed to him in time that Eleanore Jordan was his property;
that he had a right to her. His life, he felt, was full of lamentable
privations: other people had everything, he had nothing. Others
committed crimes; all he could do was to make note of the crimes.
And no man could become either satiated or rich from merely taking
the criminal incidents of other people&#8217;s lives into account.</p>

<p>At midnight he put on his sleeping gown, took a seat before
the mirror, and read until break of day a novel in which a man
fifty years old has a secret and successful love affair with a young
woman. As he read this novel he knew that something was going
on. And he knew that out there in a certain house on &AElig;gydius
Place something was also going on. Make no mistake, something
was up.</p>

<p>He saw trysts on unlighted stairways. He saw people coming
to mutual understandings by a certain pressure of the hand and
adulterous signals. That is the way they did it; that is the way
Benda and Marguerite had done it. His old hate was revived.
He transferred his hate, but also his hope, to music. Through
music he was to build a bridge to Daniel and Eleanore. He
wanted to give them the advantage of his insight, his tricks, his
experience, simply in order that he might be on hand when they
committed the gruesome deed; so that he might not be cut off
from them by an impenetrable wall and be tortured in consequence
by an incorporeal jealousy; he wanted to be one with them, to
feast his eye and reach forth his empty, senescent hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;of the same flesh and blood as
that man; in me too there is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. I have,
to be sure,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;despised women, for they are
despicable. But let some woman come forward and show me
that she is fit for anything more than to increase by two or three
the number of idiots with which the world is already overcrowded,
and I will do penance, whole and complete, and then offer her
my services as a knight.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p><p>He no longer slept or ate; nor could he do anything that was
in any way rational. In a belated sexual outburst, a second
puberty, his imagination became inflamed by a picture which he
adorned with all the perfections of both soul and body.</p>

<p>He heard that one of Daniel&#8217;s works was to be played before
invited guests at the home of Baroness von Auffenberg. He wired
to Eberhard, and asked him to get him an invitation. The reply
was a negative one. In his rage he could have murdered the messenger
boy. He then wrote to Daniel, and, boasting of what he
had already done for him, begged Daniel to see to it that he
was among the guests at the recital. He received a printed card
from the Baroness, on which she had expressed the hope that she
might be able to greet him on a certain day.</p>

<p>He was in the seventh heaven. He decided to pay Daniel a
visit, and to thank him for his kindness.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>&#8220;The only thing to do is to leave the city, to go far, far away
from here,&#8221; thought Eleanore, on that evening that was so different
from any other evening of her life.</p>

<p>While she was combing her hair, she was tempted to take the
scissors and cut it off just to make herself ugly. In the night she
went to the window to look for the stars. If it only had not
happened, if it only were a dream, a voice within her cried.</p>

<p>As soon as it turned grey in the morning, she got up. She
hastened through the deserted streets, just as she had done yesterday,
out to the suburbs. But everything was different. Tree
and bush looked down upon her with stern reproachfulness. The
mists hung low; but the hazy grey cold of the early morning
was like a bath to her. Later the sun broke through; primroses
glistened with gold on the meadow. If it could only have been
a dream, she thought in silence.</p>

<p>When she came home, her father had already received the news
about the money: it had been paid to Diruf; Daniel had taken it
to him.</p>

<p>Jordan remained in his room the whole day. And on the
following day he kept to himself except while at dinner. He sat
at the table with bowed head; he had nothing to say. Eleanore
went to his door from time to time to see if she could hear him.
There was not a sound; the house sang with solitude.</p>

<p>Jordan had requested the landlord to sublet the house before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>his lease had expired: he felt that it was too large and expensive
for him in the present state of his affairs. The landlord approved
of the idea. In the house where Daniel and Gertrude were living
there were two vacant rooms in the attic. Gertrude suggested to
her father that it would be well for him to take them. Jordan
agreed with her.</p>

<p>Eleanore began to think the situation over: if Father moves into
those rooms, I can leave him. She learned from Gertrude, who
came now to see her father every other day, that Daniel had
received the appointment as Kapellmeister at the City Theatre.
Eleanore could carry out her plans then with a clear conscience,
for her brother-in-law and her sister were getting along quite
well at present.</p>

<p>She recalled some conversations she had had with M. Rivi&egrave;re,
who had advised her to go to Paris. Since Christmas, when he was
invited to be present at the distribution of the presents, he had
been coming to Jordan&#8217;s quite frequently to talk French with
Eleanore. This was in accord with her express desire.</p>

<p>One afternoon she went to visit M. Rivi&egrave;re. He was living in
the romantic place up by the gardener on Castle Hill. His room
had a balcony that was completely overgrown with ivy and elder,
while in the background the trees and bushes of the city moat
formed an impenetrable maze of green. The spring air floated
into the room in waves. As Eleanore made her business known,
she fixed her enchanted eyes on a bouquet of lilies of the valley
that stood on the table in a bronze vase.</p>

<p>M. Rivi&egrave;re took a handful of them, and gave them to her.
They had not been cut; they had been pulled up by the roots.
Eleanore laughed happily at the fragrance.</p>

<p>M. Rivi&egrave;re said he was just about to write to his mother in
Paris, and as she was so familiar with the city, she could be of
great help to Eleanore.</p>

<p>Eleanore stepped out on the balcony. &#8220;The world is beautiful,&#8221;
she thought, and smiled at the fruitless efforts of a tiny beetle
to climb up a perpendicular leaf. &#8220;Perhaps it was after all
merely a dream,&#8221; she thought, and thereby consoled herself.</p>

<p>When she returned, Daniel was at her father&#8217;s. The two men
were sitting in the dark.</p>

<p>Eleanore lighted the lamp. Then she filled a glass with water,
and put the lilies of the valley in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel wants to know why you never visit them any more,&#8221;
said Jordan, weak and distraught as he now always was. &#8220;I told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>him you were busy at present with great plans of your own.
Well, what does the Frenchman think about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore answered her father&#8217;s question in a half audible voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go wherever you want to go, child,&#8221; said Jordan. &#8220;You have
been prepared for an independent life in the world for a long while;
there is no doubt about that. God forbid that I should put any
hindrances in your way.&#8221; He got up with difficulty, and turned
toward the door of his room. Taking hold of the latch, he
stopped, and continued in his brooding way: &#8220;It is peculiar that
a man can die by inches in a living body; that a man can have
the feeling that he&#8217;s no longer a part of the present; and that he
can no longer play his r&ocirc;le, keep up with his own people, grasp
what is going on about him, or know whether what is to come is
good or evil. It is fearful when a man reaches that stage, fearful&mdash;fearful!&#8221;</p>

<p>He left the room, shaking his head. To Daniel his words
sounded like a voice from the grave.</p>

<p>They had been silent for a long while, he and Eleanore. Suddenly
he asked gruffly: &#8220;Are you serious about going to Paris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what else can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang up, and looked angrily into her face: &#8220;One has to
be ashamed of one&#8217;s self,&#8221; he said, &#8220;human language becomes
repulsive. Don&#8217;t you have a feeling of horror when you think?
Don&#8217;t you shudder when you reflect on that caricature known as
the heart, or the soul, or whatever it may be called?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you, Daniel,&#8221; said Eleanore. She would
never have considered it possible that he would look with disfavour
on her contrition and the decision that had sprung from it. Then
it had not after all been the flash of a solitary second? Had she
not hoped and expected to hear a self-accusation from him that
would make her forget all and forgive herself? Where was she?
In what world or age was she living?</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe that I merely wanted to enjoy a diverting and
momentary side-step?&#8221; Daniel continued, measuring her with his
eyes from head to foot. &#8220;Do you believe that it is possible to
jest with the most sacred laws of nature? You have had a good
schooling, I must say; you do your teachers honour. Go! I don&#8217;t
need you. Go to Paris, and let me degenerate!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped to the door. Then he turned, and took the lamp,
which she had removed from the holder when she lighted it. Holding
the lamp in his right hand, he walked close up to her. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>eyes closed involuntarily. &#8220;I simply wanted to see whether it was
really you,&#8221; he said with passionate contempt. &#8220;Yes, it is you,&#8221;
he said scornfully, &#8220;it is you.&#8221; With that he placed the lamp
on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you, Daniel,&#8221; she said softly. She looked
around for some object to rest her eyes on.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I see. Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel!&#8221;</p>

<p>But he had already gone. The hall door closed with a bang.
The house sang with solitude.</p>

<p>The green threadbare sofa, the old, old smoke stains on the
whitewashed ceiling, the five rickety chairs that reminded her of
so many decrepit old men, the mirror with the gilded angel of
stucco at the top&mdash;all these things were so tiring, so irksome, so
annoying: they were like underbrush in the forest.</p>

<p>Little brother! Little brother!</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Three evenings of the week were devoted to opera, the others
to drama.</p>

<p>The first Kapellmeister was a middle-aged man whose curly hair
made him the idol of all flappers. He was lazy, uncultivated,
and his name was Lebrecht.</p>

<p>The director was an old stager who referred to the public about
as a disrespectful footman refers to his lord. At Daniel&#8217;s suggestions
for improving the repertory, he generally shrugged his
shoulders. The operas in which he had the greatest confidence
as drawing cards were &#8220;The Beggar Student,&#8221; &#8220;Fra Diavolo,&#8221;
&#8220;L&#8217;Africaine,&#8221; and &#8220;Robert le Diable.&#8221; The singers and the
orchestra were not much better than those of the lamented
D&ouml;rmaul-Wurzelmann troupe. The possibility of arousing them
to intensified effort or filling them with a semblance of intelligent
enthusiasm for art was even less. Privileges based on length of
service and the familiar traditions of indolence made &aelig;sthetic
innovations unthinkable.</p>

<p>Wherever careworn Philistines and slothful materialists occupy
the seats from which art should raise her voice, advancement,
progress born of sacrificial application, is out of the question: the
most it is reasonable to expect is a bourgeois fulfilment of inescapable
duties. In such, cases the flower droops; the dream vanishes;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>the free-born spirit has the choice of fighting day in and
day out against the collective demons of pettiness and mediocrity,
or of going down in admitted defeat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff the people can easily digest, my dear boy, that is the
idea,&#8221; said the director.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you so excited about? Don&#8217;t you know these people
haven&#8217;t a musical muscle in their whole soul?&#8221; said Lebrecht.</p>

<p>&#8220;For nine consecutive years I have been singing F sharp at this
opera house, and now here comes a <i>musicien</i> from the backwoods
and demands all of a sudden that I sing F!&#8221; This was the commentary
of Fr&auml;ulein Varini, the prima donna whose outstanding
bosom had long been a source of human merriment to pit, stall,
and gallery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, he is a greasy grind determined to arrive,&#8221; said the first
violinist.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a spit-fire,&#8221; said the lad who beat the big drum, when
Daniel threatened to box his ears for a false intonation.</p>

<p>The Baroness had secured a publisher in Leipzig for his cycle
of sixteen songs; the compositions were to be brought out at her
expense. That did not have the right effect: it was not something,
Daniel felt, that he had fought for and won; it was not a
case where merit had made rejection impossible. He had the
feeling that he was selling his soul and was being paid to do it.
Moreover, and worst of all, he had to express his gratitude for this
act. The Baroness loved to have somebody thank her for what she
had done. She never once suspected that what Daniel wanted was
not benefactors, but people who were stirred to the depths of their
souls by his creations. The rich cannot sense the feelings of the
poor; the higher classes remain out of contact with the lower.</p>

<p>His excitability saved him. In his magnificent solicitude for
the mission that is at once the token and the curse of those who
are really called, he shut himself off from a world from which
the one thing he wanted was bread; bread and nothing else.</p>

<p>After the publication of the songs a review appeared in the
<i>Ph&#339;nix</i> which had a remarkably realistic ring to the ear of the
layman. As a matter of fact it was merely an underhanded attempt
at assassination. The thing was signed with a big, isolated &#8220;W.&#8221;
Wurzelmann, the little slave, had shot from his ambush.</p>

<p>Other musical journals copied this review. A half dozen people
bought the songs; then they were forgotten.</p>

<p>It was no use to hope. The trouble was, he needed bread, just
bread.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p><h3>V</h3>

<p>It was often difficult for him to find the peace and quiet necessary
for effective work. May brought cold weather; they had to
make a fire; the stove smoked; the potter came in and removed the
tiles; the room looked like an inferno.</p>

<p>Gertrude was pounding sugar: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be angry at me, Daniel;
I must pound the sugar to-day.&#8221; And she pounded away until the
hammer penetrated the paralysed brain of the listener by force of
circumstances.</p>

<p>The hinges of the door screeched. &#8220;You ought to oil them,
Gertrude.&#8221; Gertrude looked high and low for the oil can, and
when she finally found it, she had no feather to use in smearing
the oil on. She went over to the chancellor&#8217;s, and borrowed one
from her maid. While she was gone, the milk boiled over and
filled the house with a disagreeable stench.</p>

<p>The door bell rang. It was the cobbler; he had come to get
the money for the patent leather shoes. The wives of Herr
Kirschner and Herr R&uuml;bsam had both said that Daniel must not
think of appearing at the coming recital at the Baroness&#8217;s without
patent leather shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the money, Gertrude; have you got that much?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude went through her chests, and scraped up five marks
which she gave the cobbler as a first instalment. The man went
away growling; Daniel hid from him.</p>

<p>Gertrude was sitting in the living room making clothes for
her baby-to-come. There was a happy expression on her face.
Daniel knew that it was a display of maternal joy and expectation,
but since he could not share this joy, since indeed he felt a sense
of fear at the appearance of the child, her happiness embittered
him.</p>

<p>Between the fuchsias in the window stood a robin red-breast;
the impish bird had its head turned to one side, and was peeping
into the room: &#8220;Come out,&#8221; it chirped, &#8220;come out.&#8221; And Daniel
went.</p>

<p>He had an engagement with M. Rivi&egrave;re at the caf&eacute; by the
market place. Since he no longer saw anything of Eleanore, he
wanted to find out how her plans for going to Paris were getting
along.</p>

<p>The Frenchman told of the progress he was making in his
Caspar Hauser research. In his broken German he told of the
murder of body and soul that had been committed in the case of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>the foundling: &#8220;He was a mortal man <i>comme une &eacute;toile</i>,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;The bourgeoisie crushed him. The bourgeoisie is the
<i>racine</i> of all evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel never mentioned Eleanore&#8217;s name. He tried to satisfy
himself by the fact that she kept out of his sight. He bit his
lips together, and said: I will. But a stronger power in him said,
No, you won&#8217;t. And this stronger power became a beggar. It
went around saying, Give me, please, give me!</p>

<p>The billiard balls rattled. A gentleman in a red velvet vest
had a quarrel with a shabby looking fellow who had been reading
<i>Fliegende Bl&auml;tter</i> for the last two hours; he would begin over
and over again at the very beginning, and break out into convulsions
of laughter every time he came to his favourite jokes.</p>

<p>Daniel was silent; he insisted somehow on remaining silent.
M. Rivi&egrave;re wished, for this reason, to hear something about the
&#8220;Harzreise.&#8221; By way of starting a discussion he remarked quite
timidly that <i>sans musique la vie est insupportable</i>, &#8220;There is something
about music that reminds one of insanity,&#8221; he remarked.
He said there were nights when he would open a volume of
Schubert&#8217;s or Brahms&#8217;s songs, leaf through them, read the notes,
and hum the melodies simply in order to escape the despair which
the conduct of the people about him was emptying into his heart.
&#8220;<i>Moi</i>, I ought to be, how do you say? stoic; <i>mais</i> I am not. In
me there is <i>trop de musique, et c&#8217;est le contraire</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel looked at him in astonishment. &#8220;Come with me,&#8221; he said
suddenly, got up, and took him by the arm.</p>

<p>They met Eleanore in the hall. She had been up in the new
flat with the whitewasher. Her father was to move in the following
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why was all this done so quickly?&#8221; asked Daniel, full of a
vague happiness that drew special nourishment from the fact that
Eleanore was plainly excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mere chance,&#8221; she said, and carefully avoided looking at him.
&#8220;A captain who is being transferred here from Ratisbon is moving
in our place. It is a pity to leave the good old rooms. The
second-hand dealer is going to get a deal of our stuff; there is
no room for it up there in those two cubby holes. How is
Gertrude? May I go up and see her for a minute or two?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, go right up,&#8221; said Daniel stiffly; &#8220;you can stay and listen
if you wish to. I am going to play the Harzreise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I wish to? I almost have a right to; you promised me this
long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;She thinks after all that I want to catch her,&#8221; he thought to
himself. &#8220;It will be better for me to drop the whole business
than to let the idea creep into her stupid skull that my composition
is going to make propaganda for our private affairs.&#8221; With
bowed head he ascended the stairs, M. Rivi&egrave;re and Eleanore following
along behind. His ears were pricked to hear anything they
might say about Paris; they talked about the weather.</p>

<p>As they entered the room Gertrude had the harp between her
knees; but she was not playing. Her hands lay on the strings,
her head was resting on the frame. &#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you lighted a
lamp?&#8221; asked Daniel angrily.</p>

<p>She was terrified; she looked at him anxiously. The expression
on her face made him conscious of many things that he had kept
in the background of his thoughts during his everyday life: her
unconditional surrender to him; the magnanimity and nobility of
her heart, which was as dependent on his as the mercury in the
thermometer is dependent on the atmosphere; her speechless resignation
regarding a thousand little things in her life! her wellnigh
supernatural ability to enter into the spirit and enjoyment of what
he was doing, however much his mind might presume to write
<i>De profundis</i> across his creations.</p>

<p>It was on this account that he recognised in her face a serious,
far-away warning. At once cowardly and reverential, conscious
of his guilt and yet feeling innocent, he went up to her and
kissed her on the hair. She leaned her head on his breast, thus
causing him to feel, though quite unaware of it herself, the whole
weight of the burden she was placing on him.</p>

<p>He told her he was going to play. He said: &#8220;I have lost my
picture again; I want to try to find it in others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude begged him, with a pale face, to be permitted to stay
in the living room. She closed the door only partly.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>In Goethe&#8217;s verses entitled &#8220;Harzreise im Winter,&#8221; thoughts
lie scattered about like erratic strata in the world of geology, and
feelings that are as big and terrible as the flames from burning
planets. In Daniel&#8217;s work the whole of Goethe&#8217;s prodigious sorrow
and solemnity seemed to have been transformed automatically
into music.</p>

<p>When, in the second half, the motif of human voices was taken
over, when these voices pealed forth first singly, one by one,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>from the surging sea of tones, and then gathered with ever-increasing
avidity, longing, and candour into the great chorus, one
had the feeling that without this liberation they would have been
stifled in the darkness.</p>

<p>The effect of the pianissimo moaning of the basses before the
soprano set in was overwhelming: it was like the vulture which,
resting with easy wing on the dark morning cloud, spies around
for booty. So was the song meant to be. The trombone solo was
a shout of victory: it imparted new life to the sunken orchestra.</p>

<p>Daniel had infinite trouble in making all this wealth of symbolic
art clear through song, word, and gesture at the same time
that his music was being played.</p>

<p>The work abounded in blends and half tones which stamped it
as a child of its age, and still more of ages to come, despite the
compact rigidity of its architecture. There was no bared sweetness
in it; it was as rough as the bark of a tree; it was as rough
as anything that is created with the assurance of inner durability.</p>

<p>Its rhythm was uniform, regular; it provided only for crescendos.
There was nothing of the seductive, nothing of the waltz-fever
in it. It was in no way cheap; it did not flatter slothful ears.
It had no languishing motifs; it was all substance and exterior.
The melody was concealed like a hard kernel in a thick shell;
and not merely concealed: it was divided, and then the divisions
were themselves divided. It was condensed, compressed, bound,
and at the same time subterranean. It was created to rise from
its depths, rejoice, and overwhelm: &#8220;But clothe the lonely one in
thy clouds of gold! Enshroud with ivy until the roses bloom
again, oh Love, the dampened hair of thy poet!&#8221;</p>

<p>The work was written a quarter of a century before its time.
It was out of touch with the nerves of its contemporary environment.
It could not hope to count upon a prophet or an interpreter.
It could not be carried further by the benevolence of
congenial champions. It bore the marks of mortal neglect. It was
like a bird from the tropics left to die on the icy coasts of
Greenland.</p>

<p>But for those who are near in heart there is a fluid in the air
that intercedes for the higher truth. M. Rivi&egrave;re and Eleanore
scarcely breathed during the recital. Eleanore&#8217;s big eyes were still:
they opened and closed slowly. When Daniel finished, he dried
his hot brow with his handkerchief, and then his arms fell limp
at his sides. He felt as if the brilliancy of Eleanore&#8217;s eyes had
reached the tips of his hair and had electrified it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;Enshroud with ivy, until the roses bloom again, oh Love, the
dampened hair of thy poet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible to get an idea of it,&#8221; murmured Daniel; &#8220;the
piano is like an instrument of torture.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were struck by peculiar sounds coming from the living
room. They went in, and found Gertrude pale as death, her
hands folded across her bosom, sitting on the sofa. She was talking
to herself, partly as if in a dream, partly as if she were praying.
It was impossible to understand what she was saying. She
seemed distant, estranged.</p>

<p>Eleanore hastened to her; Daniel looked at her with a scowl.
Just then the bell rang, and M. Rivi&egrave;re went out. There was the
sound of a man&#8217;s voice; it was disagreeable. The door was opened
and&mdash;Herr Carovius entered.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Herr Carovius bowed in all directions. He wore tan shoes with
brass buckles, black trousers, a shiny green coat, and a white
cravat that could no longer be called clean. He laid his slouch
hat on a chair, and said he would like to beg their pardon if he
had called at an inopportune hour. He had come, he said, to thank
his dear young master for the aforementioned invitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems&mdash;yes, it seems,&#8221; he added, with a droll blinking of
his eyes, &#8220;that I have in all innocence interrupted the performance
of a most interesting production. There is a crowd of people
gathered out in front of the house, and I could not forego the
pleasure of listening. I hope you will not stop playing the sacrificial
festival on my account. What was it, <i>maestro</i>? It wasn&#8217;t the
symphony, was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was the symphony,&#8221; replied Daniel, who was so amazed
at the appearance and conduct of the man that he was really
courteous.</p>

<p>&#8220;It cost me money to be sure&mdash;believe it or not. I had to get
an afternoon coat that would do for a Count&mdash;latest cut, velvet
collar, tails that reached down to my calves. Aristocratic, very!&#8221;
He stared over Gertrude&#8217;s head into the corner, and tittered for
at least a half a minute.</p>

<p>Nobody said a word. Everybody was dumb, astounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good lord, social obligations,&#8221; continued Herr Carovius, &#8220;but
after all you can&#8217;t afford to be a backwoodsman. Music is supposed
to ennoble a man even externally. By the way, there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
rumour afloat that it is a symphony with chorus. How did you
happen upon the idea? The laurels of the Ninth will not let you
sleep? I would have thought that you didn&#8217;t give a damn about
classical models. Everybody is so taken up now with musical lullabies,
<i>wage-la-wei-a</i>, that kind of stuff, you know. But then I
suppose that is only a transition stage, as the fox said when he was
being skinned.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took off his nose glasses, polished them very hastily, fumbled
for a while with his cord, and then put them on again. Having
gained time in this way, he began to expatiate on the decadence
of the arts, asked Daniel whether he had ever heard anything
about a certain Hugo Wolf who was being much talked about and
who was sitting in darkest Austria turning out songs like a Hottentot,
made a number of derogatory remarks about a fountain
that was being erected in the city, said that a company of dancers
had just appeared at the Cultural Club in a repertory of grotesque
pantomimes, remarked that as he was coming over he
learned that there was an institution in the city that loaned potato
sacks, and that there had just been a fearful fire in Constantinople.</p>

<p>Thereupon he looked first at Daniel, then at M. Rivi&egrave;re, took
the snarls of the one and the embarrassment of the other to be
encouraging signs for the continuation of his gossip, readjusted his
glasses, and sneezed. Then he smoothed out the already remarkably
smooth hairs he had left on his head, rubbed his hands as
if he were beginning to feel quite at home, and tittered when
there was any sign of a stoppage in his asinine eloquence.</p>

<p>At times he would cast a stealthy glance at Gertrude, who
would draw back somewhat as the arm of a thief who feels he is
being watched. Eleanore did not seem to be present so far as he
was concerned: he did not see her. Finally she got up. She was
tortured by the interruption of what she had just experienced from
the music and by his flat, stale, and unprofitable remarks. Then
he got up too, looked at his watch as if he were frightened, asked
if he might repeat his visit at another time, took leave of Gertrude
with a silly old-fashioned bow, from Daniel with a confidential
handshake, and from the Frenchman with uncertain courtesy.
Eleanore he again entirely overlooked.</p>

<p>Out in the hall he stopped, nodded several times, and said with
an almost insane grin, speaking into the empty air before him:
&#8220;<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>, fair one! <i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>, fairest of all!
Good-bye, my angel! Forget me not!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p><p>In the room Eleanore whispered in a heavy, anxious tone:
&#8220;What was that? What was that?&#8221;</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Philippina Schimmelweis came to help Eleanore with the moving.
At first Eleanore was quite surprised; then she became accustomed
to having her around and found her most helpful. Jordan
took no interest in anything that was going on. The last of all
his hope seemed to be shattered by the fact that he was to move.</p>

<p>Philippina gradually fell into the habit of coming every day
and working for a few hours either for Eleanore or for Gertrude,
so long as the latter had anything to do in the kitchen. They
became used to seeing her, and put up with her. She tried to
make as little noise as possible; she had the mien of a person who
is filling an important but unappreciated office.</p>

<p>She made a study of the house; she knew the rooms by heart.
She preferred to come along toward sunset or a little later. One
day she told Eleanore she had seen a mysterious-looking person
out on the hall steps. Eleanore took a candle and went out, but
she could not see any one. Philippina insisted nevertheless that
she had seen a man in a green doublet, and that he had made a
face at her.</p>

<p>She was particularly attracted by the rooms in the attic. She
told the neighbours that there was an owl up there. As a result
of this the children of that section began to fear the entire
house, while the chancellor&#8217;s wife, who lived on the ground floor,
became so nervous that she gave up her apartment.</p>

<p>There was no outside door or entrance hall of any kind to
Jordan&#8217;s new quarters. You went direct from the stairway into
the room where Eleanore worked and slept. Adjoining this was
her father&#8217;s room. People still called him the Inspector, although
he no longer had such a position.</p>

<p>He sat in his narrow, cramped room the whole day. One wall
was out of plumb. The windows he kept closed. When Eleanore
brought him his breakfast or called him to luncheon, which she
had cooked in the tiny box of a kitchen and then served in her own
little room, he was invariably sitting at the table before a stack
of papers, mostly old bills and letters. The arrangement of these
he never changed.</p>

<p>Once she entered his room without knocking. He sprang up,
closed a drawer as quickly as he could, locked it, put the key in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>his pocket, and tried to smile in an innocent way. Eleanore&#8217;s heart
almost stopped beating.</p>

<p>He never went out until it was dark, and on his return he could
be seen carrying a package under his arm. This he took with
him to his room.</p>

<p>At first Eleanore was always uneasy when she had to leave.
She requested Philippina to be very careful and see to it that no
stranger entered the house. Philippina had a box full of ribbons
in Eleanore&#8217;s cabinet. She set a chair against the door leading
into Jordan&#8217;s room; and when her hands were tired from rummaging
around in the ribbons and her eyes weary from looking at
all the flashy colours, she pressed her ear to the door to see if she
could find out what the old man was doing.</p>

<p>At times she heard him talking. It seemed as if he were talking
with some one. His voice had an exhortatory but tender tone
in it. Philippina trembled with fear. Once she even pressed
the latch; she wanted to open the door as quietly as possible, so
that she might peep in and see what was really going on. But
to her vexation, the door was bolted on the other side.</p>

<p>For Gertrude she did small jobs and ran little errands: she
would go to the baker or the grocer for her. Gertrude became
less and less active; it was exceedingly difficult for her to climb
the stairs. Philippina took the place of a maid. The only kind of
work she refused to do was work that would soil her clothes.
Gertrude&#8217;s shyness irritated her; one day she said in a snappy tone:
&#8220;You are pretty proud, ain&#8217;t you? You don&#8217;t like me, do you?&#8221;
Gertrude looked at her in amazement, and made no reply; she did
not know what to say.</p>

<p>Whenever Philippina heard Daniel coming, she hid herself.
But if he chanced to catch sight of her, he merely shrugged his
shoulders at the &#8220;frame,&#8221; as he contemptuously called her. It
seemed to him that it would be neither wise nor safe to mistreat
her. He felt that it was the better part of valour to look with
favour on her inexplicable diligence, and let it go at that.</p>

<p>Once he even so completely overcame himself that he gave her
his hand; but he drew it back immediately: he felt that he had
never touched anything so slimy in his life; he thought he had
taken hold of a frog. Philippina acted as if she had not noticed
what he had done. But scarcely had he gone into his room, when
she turned to Gertrude with a diabolic glimmer in her eyes, and,
making full use of her vulgar voice, said: &#8220;Whew! Daniel&#8217;s kind,
ain&#8217;t he? No wonder people can&#8217;t stand him!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p><p>When she saw that Gertrude knit her brow at this exclamation,
she wheeled about on the heels of her clumsy shoes, and screamed
as if the devil were after her: &#8220;Oi, oi, Gertrude, Gertrude, oi, oi,
the meat&#8217;s burning! The meat&#8217;s burning.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a false alarm. The meat was sizzling quite peacefully
in the pan.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Late in the afternoon of a stormy day in June Daniel came
home from the last rehearsal of the &#8220;Harzreise,&#8221; tired and out of
humour. The rehearsals had been held in a small room in Weyrauth&#8217;s
Garden. He had quarrelled with all the musicians and
with all the singers, male and female.</p>

<p>As he reached &AElig;gydius Place a shudder suddenly ran through
his body. He was forced to cover his eyes with his hands and
stand still for a moment; he thought he would die from longing
for a precious virginal possession which he had been so foolish as
to trifle away.</p>

<p>He went up the steps, passed by his own apartment, and
climbed on up to the apartment of Inspector Jordan and his
daughter Eleanore.</p>

<p>His eye fell on the board partition surrounding the stove and
the copper cooking utensils that hung on the wall. There sat
Eleanore, her arm resting on the window sill, her head on her
hand: she was meditating&mdash;meditating and gaining new strength as
she did so. Her face was turned toward the steep fall of a roof,
the century-old frame-work, grey walls, darkened window panes
and dilapidated wooden galleries, above which lay stillness and
a rectangular patch of sky that was then covered with clouds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening,&#8221; said Daniel, as he stepped out of the darkness
into the dimly lighted room. &#8220;What are you doing, Eleanore,
what are you thinking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore shuddered: &#8220;Ah, is it you, Daniel? You show yourself
after a long while? And ask what I am thinking about?
What curiosity! Do you want to come into my room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, sit perfectly still,&#8221; he replied, and prevented her from
getting up by touching her on the shoulder. &#8220;Is your father at
home?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. He drew a narrow bench from which he had
removed the coffee mill and a strainer up to the serving table, and
sat down as far as possible from Eleanore, though even so they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>were as close together as if they were sitting opposite each other
in a cab.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you making out?&#8221; she asked with embarrassment, and
without the remotest display of warmth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that I am beating a perforated drum, Eleanore.&#8221;
After a pause he added: &#8220;But whatever people may do or fail
to do, between us two there must be a clear understanding: Are
you going to Paris?&#8221;</p>

<p>She dropped her head in silence. &#8220;Well, I could go; there
is nothing to prevent me,&#8221; she said, softly and with hesitation.
&#8220;But you see how it is. I am no longer as I used to be. Formerly
I could scarcely picture the happiness I would derive from having
some one there in whom I could confide and who would be interested
in me. I would not have hesitated for a moment. But
now? If I go, what becomes clear from my going? And if I
stay here, what will be clear? I have already told you, Daniel,
that I don&#8217;t understand you. How terrible it is to have to say
that! What do you want now? How is all this going to come
out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanore, do you recall Benda&#8217;s last letter? You yourself
brought it to me, and after that I was a different person. He
wrote to me in that letter just as if he had never heard of Gertrude,
and said that I should not pass you by. He wrote that we two
were destined for each other, and neither for any one else in the
world. Of course you recall how I acted after reading the letter.
And even before that: Do you remember the day of the wedding
when you put the myrtle wreath on? Why, I knew then that I
had lost everything, that my real treasure had vanished. And even
before that: Do you recall that I found that Fr&auml;ulein Sylvia von
Erfft had your complexion, your figure, your hair, and your hands?
And even before that: When you went walking with Benda in the
woods, I walked along behind, and took so much pleasure in watching
you walk, but I didn&#8217;t know it. And when you came into the
room there in the Long Row, and caressed the mask and sat down
at the piano and leaned your head against the wood, don&#8217;t you
recall how indispensable you were to me, to my soul? The only
trouble is, I didn&#8217;t know it; I didn&#8217;t know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there is nothing to be done about all that: that is a
by-gone story,&#8221; said Eleanore, holding her breath, while a blush
of emotion flitted across her face only to give way to a terrible
paleness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe that I am a person to be content with what is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>past? Every one, Eleanore, owes himself his share of happiness,
and he can get it if he simply makes up his mind to it. It is
not until he has neglected it, abandoned it, and passed it by, that
his fate makes a slave out of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what I do not understand,&#8221; said Eleanore, and
looked into his face with a more cheerful sense of freedom. &#8220;It
wounds my heart to see you waging a losing battle against self-deception
and ugly defiance. We two cannot think of committing
a base deed, Daniel. It is impossible, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel, plainly excited, bent over nearer to her: &#8220;Do you know
where I am standing?&#8221; he asked, while the blue veins in his
temples swelled and hammered: &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you. I am standing
on a marble slab above an abyss. To the right and left of this
abyss are nothing but blood-thirsty wolves. There is no choice
left to me except either to leap down into the abyss, or to allow
myself to be torn to pieces by the wolves. When such a being
as you comes gliding along through the air, a winged creature like
you, that can rescue me and pull me up after it, is there any ground
for doubt as to what should be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore folded her arms across her bosom, and half closed her
eyes: &#8220;Ah no, Daniel,&#8221; she said in a kindly way, &#8220;you are exaggerating,
really. You see everything too white and too black: A
winged creature, I? Where, pray, are my wings? And wolves?
All these silly little people&mdash;wolves? Oh no, Daniel. And
blood-thirsty? Listen, Daniel, that is going quite too far; don&#8217;t
you think so yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t crush my feelings, Eleanore!&#8221; cried Daniel, in a suppressed
tone and with passionate fierceness: &#8220;Don&#8217;t crush my feelings,
for they are all I have left. You are not capable of thinking
as you have just been talking, you cannot think that low, you are
not capable of such languid, ordinary feelings. The over-tone!
The over-tone! Think a little! Can&#8217;t you see them gritting
their teeth at me? Can&#8217;t you hear them howling day and night?
Can you possibly say that they are kind or compassionate? Or are
they willing to be good and great when one comes? Do you
have confidence in a single one of them? Have they not even
dragged your good name into the mire? Are any of the things
that are sacred to you and to me sacred to them? Can they be
moved the one-thousandth part of an inch by your distress or my
distress or the distress of any human being? Is not the slime of
slander thick upon their tongues? Is not your smile a thorn in
their flesh? Do they not envy me the little I have and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>which I have flayed myself? Don&#8217;t they envy me my music, which
they do not understand, and which they hate because they do
not understand it? Would it not fill them with joy if I had
to make my living beating stones on the public highway or cleaning
out sewers? Do they find it possible to pardon me for my life
and the things that make up my life? And yet you say there are
no wolves? That they are not wolves? Tell me that you are
afraid of them, that you do not wish to turn them against yourself;
but don&#8217;t tell me that you are committing an evil act when
I call you to me, you with your wings, and you come.&#8221;</p>

<p>His arms were stretched out toward her on the top of the kitchen
table; they were trembling to the very tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The evil deed, Daniel,&#8221; whispered Eleanore, &#8220;hasn&#8217;t anything
to do with these people; it was committed against the higher law
of morals, against our feeling of right usage and established
honour....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;False,&#8221; he hissed, &#8220;false! They have made you believe that.
They have preached that to you for centuries and centuries; your
mother, your grand-mother, your great-grand-mother, they have all
been telling you that. It is false; it is a lie; it is all a lie. It is
with this very lie that they support their power and protect their
organisation. It is truth on the contrary that fills my heart, fills
it with joy, and helps me along. What nature offers, obedience
to nature, that is truth. Truth lies in your thoughts, in your feelings,
girl, in your choked feelings, in your blood, in the &#8216;yes&#8217; you
speak in your dreams. Of course I know that they need their lie,
for they must be organised, the wolves; they must go in packs,
otherwise they are impotent. But I have only my truth, only my
truth as I stand on the marble slab above the abyss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your truth, Daniel,&#8221; said Eleanore, &#8220;<i>your</i> truth. But your
truth is not my truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Eleanore? No? Not yours? What then is the use of
my talking with you? And even if everything else were falsehood
and error, I am as convinced as I can be that my truth is also
your truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t stand out against the whole world,&#8221; said Eleanore
in anguish, &#8220;you are after all in the world yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will take my stand against the whole world,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;that is precisely what I have made up my mind to do. I will
pay them back in their own coin. Just as they have all stood
against me, just so will I stand against them. I am no compromiser,
no treaty-maker, no haggler, no beggar. I live according to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>own law. I <i>must</i>, where other people merely <i>should</i> or <i>may</i>, or
<i>may not</i>. Whoever does not comprehend that has nothing in common,
one way or the other, with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was terrified at the presumptuousness of his words; and yet
there was a feeling in her of joy and pride: she felt a desire to
be for him, to be with him. If he was fighting against the very
power that would in the end overcome him, he was doing it for
her sake. She did not feel, therefore, that she had the right to
withdraw from him. The thing about it all that gave her a
wonderful feeling of relief, and at the same time made her morally
flabby and carried her away, was the passion of his will and the
undaunted assurance of his feelings.</p>

<p>But their eyes chanced to meet; and in the eyes of each there
was the name of Gertrude.</p>

<p>Gertrude stood between them in living form. Everything they
had said had proceeded from her and returned to her. That
Daniel was not thinking of annulling his marriage, that he could
not think of it, Eleanore knew. A child was expected; who could
reject the mother under these circumstances? How would it be
possible, poor as they were, to expose both mother and child to the
inevitable misery that would follow annulment of the marriage?
Daniel could not do this, and Eleanore knew it.</p>

<p>But she also knew, for she knew her sister, that separation from
Daniel would mean her death. She knew too that Daniel considered
his marriage to Gertrude as indissoluble, not only because
of his knowledge of her character, but because there was in his
life with Gertrude something that is quite independent of passions,
views, and decisions, something that binds even in hate and binds
even more firmly in despair.</p>

<p>Eleanore knew all this. She knew that Daniel knew it. And
if she drew the only conclusion that could be drawn from his
argument and his state of mind, she knew what he demanded of
her.</p>

<p>He was demanding that she give herself up to him. Of this
there could be not a shred of doubt.</p>

<p>But how? Secretly? Could that produce happiness? With
the understanding of Gertrude? Could Gertrude endure such a
thought, even if she were as magnanimous as a saint? Where was
the way that could be followed? Where was there an angle from
which embarrassment, anxiety, and ruin were not ready to leap
forth without warning?</p>

<p>She bowed her head, and covered it with her hands. She sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>in this position for a long while. Darkness settled down over
the roofs of the houses.</p>

<p>Suddenly she got up, reached him her hand, smiled with tears
in her eyes, and said with a last attempt to escape the horrible
consequences, &#8220;Br&uuml;derlein.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>...&#8221; She spoke the word in a tone
of longing fervour and half-humorous appealing.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> &#8220;Little brother.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>He shook his head sadly, but took her hand and held it tenderly
between his.</p>

<p>Her face became clouded; it was like a landscape at the coming
of night. Her eyes, turned to one side, saw the trees of a great
garden, an ugly old woman sitting by a hedge, and two little
girls who looked into the setting sun with fear in their hearts.</p>

<p>There was a noise; she and Daniel were startled. In the doorway
stood Philippina Schimmelweis. Her eyes glistened like the
skin of a reptile that has just crept up from out of the bog.</p>

<p>Daniel went down to his apartment.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>For nine years the rococo hall in the Auffenberg home had been
closed to festive celebrations of every kind. It took a long, tedious
exchange of letters between the secretary of the Baron living in
Rome and the secretary of the Baroness to get the permission of the
former to use the hall.</p>

<p>The indignation at Nothafft&#8217;s work was general. The members
of the social set could hardly contain themselves, while the
amateurs and specially invited guests were likewise but little edified.
The chief diversion of the evening, in fact, was to see the composer
himself conduct. At the sight of the jumping and sprawling
fellow, Herr Z&ouml;llner, councillor of the consistory, almost burst
with laughter.</p>

<p>Old Count Schlemm-Nottheim, who not only had a liking for
pornographic literature but was also known to drink a quarter of a
litre of Dr. Rosa&#8217;s balsam of life every afternoon, declared that
the ensemble playing of all the instruments represented by the
show-booths at the annual fair was an actual musical revelation in
comparison with this Dutch concert of rogues&#8217; marches. Judge
Braun of the Supreme Court gave it as his candid opinion that
there was evidently a conspiracy against good taste.</p>

<p>Remarks of this kind were, of course, made behind screens and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>in the corners. In order not to offend the Baroness, there was a
goodly measure of seemingly cordial applause. The guests and
artists then assembled around a huge table arranged in the shape
of a horseshoe.</p>

<p>Count Schlemm-Nottheim was the table companion of the
Baroness; he had her tell him who the various personages from the
world of art were. He asked who was the woman of such interesting
melancholy sitting next to Major Bellmann. He was told
that that was the wife of the composer. His wife? She is not
at all bad; life with her would be rather worth while. And who
was the woman between old Herold and the Frenchman? A
charming little creature: she had eyes like the Lake of Liguria and
hands like a princess. That was the sister of the composer&#8217;s wife.
Sister? You don&#8217;t tell me! A jolly fine family; worth the support
of any man.</p>

<p>Toasts were drunk. Herr Ehrenreich, the wholesale merchant,
drank to the health of the creator of the &#8220;Harzreise&#8221;; the Count
to the ladies present.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius created a sensation. He sat with the members
of the &#8220;Liedertafel&#8221;; they had sung in the chorus; and they were
ashamed of him, for he conducted himself in a most unseemly
fashion.</p>

<p>He had somehow managed to get hold of a glove Eleanore had
lost, and possibly it was this that made him so convivial. He
picked up an almond shell from the serving tray, and threw it at
Fr&auml;ulein Varini. He let his leery, lascivious eyes roam about over
the cut glass and the decorations of the hall, and never once grew
tired of praising the wealth and splendour of the house. He
acted as though he were quite at home. He raised his wine glass,
and declared that he was charmed by the flavour and colour of the
costly, precious juice from the grape: he tried to give the impression
that he knew the Auffenberg wine cellar from years of intimate
association with it.</p>

<p>Then it happened that through a hasty, awkward movement, he
upset his plate; a rivulet of rich brown gravy ran down over his
white vest. He became silent; he retired within himself. He
dipped his napkin in the water, and rubbed and rubbed. The
waiters tittered. He buttoned up his coat, and looked like a
show window in the dead of night.</p>

<p>The eyes of the waiters were also given the privilege of feasting
on another rare social phenomenon. They noticed that Kapellmeister
Nothafft was sitting at the table in his stocking feet. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>patent leather shoes had hurt him so much that he made short
work of it and took them off during the dinner. There they
stood without master or servant, one at the right, the other at the
left of his disencumbered feet. Whenever the waiters passed by,
they would cast one furtive but profitable glance under the table,
and bite their lips to keep from bursting out in laughter.</p>

<p>This rude offence to social dignity was not unknown to the
other dinner guests. They whispered, smiled, shrugged their
shoulders, and shook their heads. Daniel made no effort to conceal
his bootlessness when the guests rose to leave the table; without
giving the astonishment of his companions a single thought, he
once more drew the patent leather torturers on to his extremities.
But he had made a mistake: he had gambled and lost.</p>

<p>The news of the extraordinary event was fully exploited on the
following day. It was carried from house to house, accumulated
momentous charm in its course, passed from the regions of the high
to those of the less high and quite low, and provoked storms of
laughter everywhere. No one had anything to say about the
symphony; everybody was fully informed concerning the patent
leather episode.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>On the way home Daniel walked with Eleanore. Gertrude
followed at some distance with M. Rivi&egrave;re; she could not walk
rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you find it, Eleanore? Didn&#8217;t you have the feeling
that you were at a feast of corpses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear,&#8221; she murmured; they walked on.</p>

<p>After they had gone along for some time in perfect silence,
they came to a narrow gateway. Eleanore suddenly felt that she
could no longer endure Daniel&#8217;s mute questioning. She pulled
her silk veil closer to her cheeks, and said: &#8220;Give me time! Don&#8217;t
hurry me! Please give me time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t given you time, my dear girl, I should not have
deserved this moment,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot, I cannot,&#8221; she said, with a sigh of despair. She had
only one hope, one ray of hope left, and her whole soul was fixed
on that. But she was obliged to act in silence.</p>

<p>Standing in the living room with Gertrude, Daniel&#8217;s eye fell
on the mask of Zingarella; it had been decorated with rose twigs.
Under the green young leaves fresh buds shone forth; they hung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>around the white stucco of the mask like so many little red lanterns.
&#8220;Who did that?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanore was here in the afternoon; she did it,&#8221; replied
Gertrude.</p>

<p>His burning eyes were riveted on the mask, when Gertrude
stepped up to him, threw her arms around him, and in the fulness
of her feelings exclaimed: &#8220;Daniel, your work was wonderful,
wonderful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So? Did you like it? I am glad to hear it,&#8221; he said, in a
tone of dry conventionality.</p>

<p>&#8220;The people don&#8217;t grasp it,&#8221; she said gently, and then added
with a blush: &#8220;But I understand it; I understand it, for it belongs
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following day he laid the score of the &#8220;Harzreise&#8221; together
with the words in a big old chest, and locked it. It was like a
funeral.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>In the dark, winding alleys behind the city wall stand little
houses with large numbers and coloured lanterns. They are filled
with a sweetish, foul odour, and have been laboriously built up
out of dilapidated lumber-rooms. From the cracks in the closed
blinds come forth, night after night, the sounds of shrill laughter.
Those who enter are received by half-nude monsters, and are made
to sit down on monstrous chairs and sofas covered with red
plush.</p>

<p>The citizen calls these places dens of vice. Between Friday
and Sunday he thinks with lustful horror of the inhabitants with
their bloated or emaciated bodies and the sad or intoxicated stare
of their eyes.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius wended his way to this quarter of the city.
Because it was only a shadow which he embraced in hours when
his inflamed imagination, vitiated by all the poisons of the earth,
conjured up a human body, he was angry; now he went there, and
bought himself a real human body.</p>

<p>After he had been in a half a dozen of these houses, had been
jubilantly greeted, and then thrown out to the accompaniment of
bawdy abuse, he at last found what he had been looking for: a
creature whose cunning had not entirely been lost, who still had
the features of a daughter of man, and whose figure and character
still had the power to call up a memory, provided one were firmly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>decided to see what one wished to see and to forget what one
wished to forget.</p>

<p>Her name was Lena, charming reminder of a desired reality!
He went with her as she left the circle of her companions, and
followed her into the wretched hole between winding stairs and
attic rooms. He rattled the coins in his pocket, and gave his
orders. The nymph had to put on a street dress, set a modest hat
on her head, and draw a veil over her rouged face. Thereupon he
went up to her, spoke to her courteously, and kissed her hand.
He had never in his life acted in so polite and chivalric a fashion
in the presence of a woman.</p>

<p>The prostitute was frightened; she ran away. She had to be
given instructions; these were given her by the madame of the
house; for Herr Carovius was rattling the coins in his pocket.
&#8220;You will have to be patient and indulgent; we are not prepared
for such refined guests here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned. Lena had been told what to do. She soon fell
into her r&ocirc;le.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be frank,&#8221; he said to Lena, &#8220;I am inexperienced in the
arts of love. I am too proud to kowtow to the berobed and
bodiced idol. A woman is a woman, and a man is a man. They
delude themselves and each other, or try to, into believing that
each woman is a special person, and each man a man to himself.
Idiocy!&#8221;</p>

<p>The prostitute grinned.</p>

<p>He walked back and forth; the room was just large enough to
allow him to take three steps. He recalled the expression on
Eleanore&#8217;s face during the performance of the symphony; his
greedy eyes had rested on her all the while. He became enraged:
&#8220;You don&#8217;t imagine that progress can be made by such amateurish
efforts?&#8221; he said with a roar. &#8220;It is all hocus-pocus. There is as
a matter of fact no such thing as progress in art, any more than
there is progress in the course of the stars. Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>He bellowed forth the first motif from the &#8220;Sonata quasi una
fantasia&#8221; of Mozart: &#8220;Listen to this: Da&mdash;dada&mdash;da&mdash;daddaa! Is
it possible to progress beyond that? Don&#8217;t let them make a fool
of you, my angel. Be honest with yourself. He has hypnotised
you. He has turned your unsuspecting heart upside down. Look
at me! Are you afraid of me? I will do all in my power for
you. Give me your hand. Speak to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The prostitute was obliged to stretch out her arms. He sat
down beside her with a solemn ceremoniousness. Then he removed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>the pin from her hat, and laid the hat tenderly to one side. She
had to lean her head on his shoulder.</p>

<p>With that he fell into a dreamy meditation.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Philippina came up to Gertrude in the living room. Daniel
was not at home. Philippina was humming the latest street song,
the refrain of which ran as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<i><span class="i0">Drah&#8217; di, Madel, drah&#8217; di,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Morgen kommt der Mahdi.<br /></span></i>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; said Philippina, and threw a ball of yarn on
the table.</p>

<p>Gertrude had yielded to the girl&#8217;s importunities, and was addressing
her now with the familiar &#8220;thou&#8221; and allowing Philippina
to do the same in speaking to her. &#8220;We are after all relatives,
you know, Gertrude,&#8221; said Philippina.</p>

<p>Gertrude was afraid of Philippina; but she had thus far found
no means of defending herself against her exaggerated eagerness
to help her with the housework. And she felt in Philippina&#8217;s
presence what she felt in the presence of no one else&mdash;a sense of
shame at her own condition.</p>

<p>Philippina, in fact, saw something indecent in Gertrude&#8217;s pregnancy;
when she talked to her she always held her head up and
looked into space; her action was quite conspicuous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but ain&#8217;t people impudent,&#8221; Philippina began, after she
had taken a loutish position on a chair. &#8220;The clerk over in the
store asked me whether there wasn&#8217;t something up between Daniel
and Eleanore. What d&#8217;ye think of that? Fresh, yes? You bet
I give him all that was coming to him!&#8221;</p>

<p>The needle in Gertrude&#8217;s fingers stopped moving. It was not
the first time that Philippina had made such insinuating remarks.
To-day she would come up to Gertrude, and whisper to her that
Daniel was upstairs with Eleanore; yesterday she had said in a
tone of affected sympathy that Eleanore looked so run down.
Then she gave a detailed report of what this person and that person
had said; then she turned into a champion of good morals and
gentle manners, and remarked that you ought not offend people.</p>

<p>Her every third word was &#8220;people.&#8221; She said she knew what
a faultless character Eleanore had and how Daniel loved his wife,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>but people! And after all you couldn&#8217;t scratch everybody&#8217;s eyes
out who annoyed you with dubious questions; if you did, there
would soon be very few eyes left.</p>

<p>Philippina&#8217;s bangs had acquired an unusual length; they covered
her whole forehead down to her eyelashes. The glances she cast
at Gertrude had on this account something especially malevolent
about them. &#8220;She is not so certain of herself and her family
after all,&#8221; thought Philippina, and made a lewd gesture with her
legs as she sprawled on the chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, I think Daniel ought to be more cautious,&#8221; she
said with her rasping voice. &#8220;This being together all alone for
hours at a time ain&#8217;t going to do no good; no good at all, I say.
And the two are always running after each other; if it&#8217;s not her,
it&#8217;s him. If you happen to take &#8217;em by surprise, they jump like
criminals. It&#8217;s been going on this way for six weeks, day after
day. Do you think that&#8217;s right? You don&#8217;t need to put up with
it, Gertrude,&#8221; she said in conclusion, making a sad attempt to look
coquettish. Then she cast her eyes to the floor, and looked as
innocent as a child.</p>

<p>Gertrude&#8217;s heart grew cold. Her confidence in Daniel was
unfaltering, but the venomous remarks made to her left her without
peace of mind or body; she could not think clearly. The very
fact that such things were being said about Daniel and Eleanore,
and that words failed her to stop them because from the very
beginning she had borne it all with the self-assurance that naturally
springs from contempt for gossip, only tended to make her grief
all the more bitter.</p>

<p>How hollow any objection on her part would have sounded!
How fatuous and ineffective a rebuke from her would have been!
Could she muzzle these wicked, slanderous tongues by referring to
the peculiarities of Daniel&#8217;s nature? Could he be expected to go
to Philippina and give an account of himself? A contemptuous
smile came to her face when she pondered on such possibilities.</p>

<p>And yet, why was she heart-sore? Was it because she was at
last beginning to realise that she was unloved?</p>

<p>Involuntarily her eyes fell on the mask; it was still covered
with the withered rose twigs. She got up and removed them.
Her hand trembled as if she were committing some evil act.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go home, Philippina, I don&#8217;t need you any more,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, it is late, ain&#8217;t it? I must be going,&#8221; cried Philippina.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Gertrude,&#8221; she said by way of consolation. &#8220;And
don&#8217;t complain of me to your husband; he&#8217;ll git ugly if you do.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>If you say anything bad about me, there&#8217;s going to be trouble here,
I say. I am a perfect fool; people git out of my way, they do.
I&#8217;ve got a wicked mouth, I have; there&#8217;s no stopping it. Well,
good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rubbed her hands down over her skirt, as if she were
trying to smooth out the wrinkles; there was an element of comic
caution in what she did.</p>

<p>Out on the street she began to hum again:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<i><span class="i0">Drah&#8217; di, Madel, drah&#8217; di,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Morgen kommt der Mahdi.<br /></span></i>
</div></div>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>When Daniel came home, it was late; but he sat down by
the lamp in his room and began to read Jean Paul&#8217;s &#8220;Titan.&#8221; In
the course of time his thoughts liberated themselves from the book
and went their own way. He got up, walked over to the piano,
raised the lid, and struck a chord; he listened with closed eyes:
it seemed that some one was calling him. It was a sultry night;
the stillness was painful.</p>

<p>Again he struck the chord: bells from the lower world. They
rang up through the green, grey mists, each distinct and delicate.
Each tone sent forth its accompanying group like sparks from a
skyrocket. Those related by the ties of harmony joined; those
that were alien fell back and down. And up in the distant, inaccessible
heights there rang out with deceiving clarity, like the last
vision of earthly perfection, the melody of love, the melody of
Eleanore.</p>

<p>Yet, some one was calling him; but from where? His wife?
The distant, gloomy, waiting one? He closed the piano; the echo
of the noise made thereby rebounded from the church wall
through his window.</p>

<p>He put out the lamp, went into his bedroom, and undressed
by the light of the moon. The border of the curtain was embroidered
with heavy Vitruvian scrolls, the shadows of which were
reflected on the floor; they made jagged, goalless paths. All these
lines consisted after all of only one line.</p>

<p>As he lay in bed his heart began to hammer. Suddenly he
knew, without looking, that Gertrude was not asleep; that she
was lying there staring at the ceiling just as he was. &#8220;Gertrude!&#8221;
he called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p><p>From the slight rustling of the pillow he concluded that she
turned her face to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you hear me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Daniel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must give me some advice; you must help me: help me and
your sister, otherwise I cannot say what may happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped and listened, but there was not a stir: the stillness
was absolute.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is at times possible to remain silent out of consideration
for others,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;but if the silence is maintained too
long, deception follows, and falsehood does not fail. But of what
use is candour if it thrusts a knife into the heart of another merely
in order to prepare an unblocked path for him who is candid?
What good does it do to confess if the other does not understand?
Two are already bleeding to death; shall the third meet with the
same fate merely in order to say that the matter was talked over?
The truth is, too many words have already been spoken, gruesome,
shameless words, at the sound of which the innocent night of
the senses vanishes. And must one bleed to death when it becomes
clearer and clearer that those are not eternal laws against which
war is being waged? How can I, dwarf that I am, attack eternal
laws? No, it is the frail, mutable customs of human society&mdash;?
Are you listening, Gertrude?&#8221;</p>

<p>A &#8220;yes&#8221; that sounded like a note from a bird on a distant hill
greeted his ears: it was the answer to his question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have reached the point where silence is no longer thinkable:
there is no going any farther without you. I will neither exaggerate
nor have recourse to conventional phrases: I will not speak
of passion nor say that it could not be helped. It is just barely
possible that everything can be helped; that a man could always
have done differently if he had begun soon enough. But who
can ever tell what the future may bring? And passion? There
are many varieties of passion. It is the term that every swain,
washed and unwashed, uses in referring to his lusts. I had never
felt a passion for which a woman was guilty. But now one has
seized me with hide and hair. I had imagined that I could get
out of it and not bring you into it; impossible! I am burning
up with this passion, Gertrude, my whole being has been changed
by it; and if help is not given me, I will be ruined.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a time there was a death-like stillness in the room; then
he continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;But where is help to come from? It is strange; never until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>this thing happened did I know what holds us two together, you
and me. Threads are being spun back and forth between us which
no hand may touch without withering, as it is written in the
Bible. There is a secret, a sacred secret, and if I offended it I
would feel as though I had strangled the unborn child in your
womb; and not only the child in your womb, but all the unborn
children in my own breast. There is in the life of each man a
woman in whom his own mother becomes young again, and to
whom he is bound by an unseen, indestructible, umbilical cord.
Face to face with this woman, his love, great or small, even his
hate, his indifference, becomes a phantom, just as everything that
we give out becomes a phantom compared with what is given to us.
And there is another woman who is my own creation, the fruit
of my dreams; she is my picture; I have created her from my
own blood; she lay in me just as the seed lay in the bud. And she
must be mine once she has been unveiled and made known to me,
or I will perish of loneliness and maddened longing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The extravagant man pressed his face to the pillow and groaned:
&#8220;She must be mine, or I will never get up from this bed. But
if my way to her passes over you, Gertrude, I would have to cry
out with Faust: &#8216;Oh, had I never been born!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude never uttered a sound. Minute after minute passed by.
Daniel, growing calmer, listened to see if he could not hear some
sound in the room. He heard nothing. The silence of his wife
began to fill him with anxiety; he rose up in bed. The moon
had gone down; it was pitch dark. He felt around for some
matches, and lighted a candle. Holding it in his hand, he bent
over Gertrude. She was as pale as death; she was looking at the
ceiling with wide-opened eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put the candle out, Daniel,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;I have something
to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put the candle out, and set it away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me your hand, Daniel.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt for her hand; he took hold of it. It was ice cold;
he laid it on his breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I stay with you, Daniel? Will you tolerate me in your
home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tolerate? Gertrude, tolerate?&#8221; he asked, in a lifeless, toneless
voice. &#8220;You are my wife, in the presence of God my wife,&#8221;
he added, in deadened memory of the words of another.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will become your mother made young again, as you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Gertrude, but how?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;I will help you, you and Eleanore. The hearts of you two
shall not bleed to death because of me. Let me stay; that is
all I ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is more easily said than done, Gertrude.&#8221; He pressed
close up to her, took her in his arms, and sobbed with unexpected
violence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hard; yes, it is hard. But your heart must not be allowed
to bleed on my account.&#8221;</p>

<p>His head lay on her breast; he was seized with convulsions of
grief that would not let him go until break of day.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden the words came like a scream from
Gertrude&#8217;s lips: &#8220;I too am a creature.&#8221;</p>

<p>He embraced her with warmth; and she murmured: &#8220;It is hard,
Daniel, but be of good cheer, be of good cheer.&#8221;</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>Pflaum, the apothecary, had begun to feel cramped in his house
near the Church of the Holy Ghost. He had looked at several
houses in the last week or two, and had finally decided on the
Schimmelweis property, which was now for sale. The apothecary
shop was to remain for the time being at its present location, and
Jason Philip was likewise to keep his store and his residence. Herr
Pflaum, being the landlord, intended to occupy the first and second
floors; he had a large family.</p>

<p>One beautiful August afternoon, the two men&mdash;the apothecary
and the bookseller&mdash;left the office of Judge R&uuml;bsam, where they
had gone to sign the papers transferring the mortgage on the
Schimmelweis property. A cloudless sky, already tinted with the
blue of the descending sun, shone over the city.</p>

<p>Herr Pflaum looked the picture of happiness: his troubles
seemed all to be behind him; he was manifestly facing the future
without fear and without care. Jason Philip Schimmelweis, on
the contrary, was plainly worried. He looked like a man who
was on the down grade. There was a great grease spot on his coat.
This spot told the story of domestic troubles; it revealed the fact
that Jason Philip had a wife who had been ill in bed for months,
and no physician in the city could diagnose her case; none knew
what she was suffering from. Jason Philip was angry at his wife,
at her illness, at the whole medical profession, and at the growing
confusion and disorder in his affairs.</p>

<p>As they crossed &AElig;gydius Place he cast a glance of unbounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>hatred at the house in which Daniel and Gertrude lived. But
he did not say anything; he merely pinched his lips and hung his
head. In so doing he noticed the grease spot on his coat, and
emitted a vexed growl. &#8220;I will go along with you, Herr Apothecary,
and get a bottle of benzine,&#8221; he said, turning to his companion.
In his voice there was a noticeable trace of that reluctant
and unwilling humility which the poor display in the presence of
the rich.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, good,&#8221; he said, &#8220;come right along.&#8221; He blew the air
before him; for he was warm. &#8220;Greetings, greetings,&#8221; he exclaimed,
and waved his hand, &#8220;what are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Herr Carovius to whom he spoke. Herr Carovius was
just then standing by the fountain of the Goose Man, rapt in
the sort of reflection that was peculiar to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;At your service, gentlemen,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see there are natives who study our native art,&#8221; remarked
the apothecary with an ironical smile, and stopped. Jason Philip
likewise stopped, and looked in a dazed, distraught way at the
bronze man with the two geese. Some boys were playing ball
close by the fountain. When they saw the three men looking at it,
they quit playing, came up, and looked at the fountain and the
men and grinned as if there were something new to be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no idea what riches we possess,&#8221; said Herr Carovius.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right, quite right,&#8221; nodded the apothecary.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just been trying to think what meaning this group may
have,&#8221; continued Herr Carovius, &#8220;there is undeniably a musical
motif in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A musical motif?&#8221; murmured Jason Philip, to whom the very
term music conveyed the idea of something unpleasant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but you have got to understand it,&#8221; said Herr Carovius
rather jauntily. With that he seized the ear of a small boy who
had ventured right up to his trousers&#8217; legs; the boy screamed.</p>

<p>After casting an angry look at the monument, Jason Philip broke
out in sudden and hearty laughter. &#8220;Now I understand,&#8221; he
stammered as he coughed, &#8220;you are a fox, a sly old dodger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, gentlemen?&#8221; asked the apothecary, who had
become somewhat anxious, for he feared that this outburst of
hilarity was directed at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, don&#8217;t you see? Don&#8217;t you understand?&#8221; panted Jason
Philip with a scarlet red face, &#8220;the two geese&mdash;? The musical
motif and the two geese&mdash;? Isn&#8217;t it clear yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was clear to Herr Carovius. He stuck the index finger of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>his right hand in the air, and broke out in a neighing sort of
laughter. Then he took the apothecary by the arm, and in the
pauses between salvos of laughter he bleated: &#8220;Magnificent!&mdash;Under
each arm a goose!&mdash;Priceless! Say, Herr Schimmelweis,
that was good. We will allow you one on that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The connection was now clear to the apothecary. He slapped
himself on his hips and cried: &#8220;As sure as there is a devil, that&#8217;s
the best joke I ever heard in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jason Philip Schimmelweis again got control of himself. He
pressed his hands to his stomach and said breathlessly: &#8220;Who would
have thought that the Goose Man moves about among us in bodily
form?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, who would have thought it?&#8221; said Herr Carovius as if
conceding a point. &#8220;It is a capital shot, a real discovery. We
come to the simple conclusion: Goose Man! And we are capable
of drawing a conclusion, for there are three of us. According to
an old proverb, <i>Tres faciunt collegium.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they,&#8221; stuttered Jason Philip, pointing to the group, as
tears of laughter trickled down over his pudgy cheeks, &#8220;they are
three, too. See, there are three of them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; screamed Herr Carovius, &#8220;there are three of them, too.
It is all clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a chew, gentlemen?&#8221; said the apothecary, taking his
tobacco pouch from his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Jason Philip, &#8220;that joke deserves a cigar.&#8221; The
remark was made between gulps of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suggest that we christen the story with a flask of Salvator,&#8221;
said Herr Carovius.</p>

<p>The other two agreed to the proposal. The <i>collegium</i> marched
across the square, stopped every now and then, broke out in fits of
insuppressible laughter, and then continued on their way to the inn
with parched throats.</p>

<p>It may have been only an evening shadow, or it may have been a
rare inspiration that created the impression. But the Goose Man,
standing there in all his pride behind the iron railing, seemed to
follow them with his eyes, in which there were traces of sorrow
and astonishment. The boys playing ball had soon forgotten the
delectable episode.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Daniel</span> and Eleanore had reached a stage of mutual silence;
it was not the first time, however, and it was as disagreeable now
as it had been then. They would meet on the steps, and pass each
other with a mere nod. If Eleanore came in to see Gertrude,
Daniel withdrew.</p>

<p>Once Eleanore called when Gertrude was not at home. Daniel
was stubborn; nor could Eleanore manage to make a single rational
remark. He did not like her looks; he suspected her paleness
and outward, enforced cheerfulness. &#8220;It is an undignified state
of affairs, Eleanore,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;we must make an end of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Make an end of it? Yes&mdash;but how? This was the thought that
came at once to Eleanore&#8217;s mind. Every day the chain that bound
her to him became stronger.</p>

<p>Daniel was also tortured by the sight of Gertrude. He felt
that she was watching him and that she was worried about him.
More than that, the event was approaching that surrounded her
with an atmosphere of suffering and made forbearance obligatory.
Her features, though haggard and distorted, bore nevertheless an
expression of mysterious transfiguration.</p>

<p>After Gertrude had noticed for some time that Daniel was being
estranged from his work and that he had lost interest in everything,
she decided to have a talk with Eleanore. She did it without
preparation or tenderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see that you are ruining him?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want me to be ruined, do you?&#8221; asked Eleanore, in surprised
dismay. She had appreciated at once and without difficulty
the complete range of Gertrude&#8217;s renunciation.</p>

<p>&#8220;What difference does it make about you?&#8221; replied Gertrude
harshly; &#8220;what are you getting excited about?&#8221;</p>

<p>This question made Eleanore&#8217;s ideas of order and duty quake
and totter. She looked at her sister with incredulous eyes and
in perfect silence. It was not the happy, gentle Gertrude that had
spoken, but the Gertrude of months ago, the lonely, loveless
Gertrude.</p>

<p>What difference does it make about you? Why are you getting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>excited? That was equivalent to saying: Make short work of your
life, and don&#8217;t draw out the episode in his life any longer than
you have to.</p>

<p>Eleanore took courage to carry out the plan she had had in mind
for a long while and in which she placed her last hope.</p>

<p>One evening she went to Daniel and said: &#8220;I should like to go
with you to Eschenbach, Daniel, and visit your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you wish to do that?&#8221; he asked in amazement. He
and his mother did not write to each other: that was due first of
all to their natures, and secondly to the condition in which each
was now living. But he knew that Eleanore received an occasional
letter from Eschenbach which she answered without consulting him.
This had never seemed strange to him until now.</p>

<p>A few days later she repeated her wish; Daniel granted it.
They decided upon the following Sunday for the excursion.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>A warm, languid October sun shone over the land; the forests
presented a gorgeous array of autumnal foliage; the fields lay
stretched in barren rows; along the hills of Franconia floated clouds
that looked like down driven by the wind.</p>

<p>They had taken the train as far as Triesdorf; from there they
went on to Merckendorf by stage coach. The rest of the distance
they walked. Daniel pointed to a flock of geese that were trotting
around on the shore of an abandoned pond, and said: &#8220;That is
our national bird; his cackle is our music. But it doesn&#8217;t sound
so bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>A peasant woman passed by, and made the sign of the cross
before the picture of a saint: &#8220;It is strange that everything has
suddenly become Catholic,&#8221; said Eleanore.</p>

<p>Daniel nodded, and replied that when his father moved to
Eschenbach a few other Protestant families were living there, all
of whom joined in Protestant worship. Later, he said, most of
them emigrated, leaving his mother as the only Protestant, so far
as he knew, in the neighbourhood. But, Daniel remarked in the
course of conversation, his mother had never had any unpleasant
experience on this account, and he himself had frequently gone to
church, primarily of course to hear the organ, though no one had
ever taken offence at this. &#8220;There is a totally different type of
people here,&#8221; he added, &#8220;people who lay greater stress on externals
than we do, and yet are more secretive.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p><p>Eleanore looked at the church tower whose Spanish-green roof
rose from the valley. After a long silence she said: &#8220;I wonder
whether it will be a boy or a girl, Gertrude&#8217;s baby? Oh, a girl,
of course. Some day it will be in the world, and will look at me
with eyes, with real eyes. How strange that a child of yours
should look at me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there strange about that? Many children are born,
many look at some one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to call it?&#8221; asked Eleanore.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is blond and has blue eyes like yours, I am going to
call it Eva.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eva!&#8221; cried Eleanore, &#8220;no, that won&#8217;t do.&#8221; She herself had
chosen the name of Eva for the child of the maid at the R&uuml;digers&#8217;.
That he should now want to call Gertrude&#8217;s child by the same
name seemed so strange to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not Eva?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;There is something back of this
objection on your part. Women always have something up their
sleeve. Out with it! Why do you object to Eva?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore smiled, and shook her head. She would have liked
to make a clean confession to him, but she was not certain how he
would take it: she was afraid he would turn back, enraged at her
cunning. Once the child had been born and lay there before
him, it would captivate him, and she knew it.</p>

<p>They had stopped and were looking out over the sunlit plains.
&#8220;How alone we are!&#8221; said Daniel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is easier here,&#8221; said Eleanore thoughtfully. &#8220;If
one could only forget where one comes from, it would be easy to
be happy.&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>&#8220;I have been away for seven years,&#8221; said Daniel as they passed
through the village gate. Everything seemed so ridiculously small&mdash;the
Town Hall, the Church, the Market Place, and the Eschenbach
Fountain. He had also pictured the houses and streets to
himself as being cleaner and better kept. As he passed over the
three steps at the front gate, each one of which was bulging out
like a huge oyster shell, and entered the shop with its smell of
spices, the past dwindled to nothing. Marian was so happy she
could not speak. She reached one of her hands to Daniel, the
other to Eleanore. Her first question was about Gertrude.</p>

<p>In the room sat a four-year-old child with blond hair and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>marvellous blue eyes. Its little face was of the most delicate beauty,
its body was delicately formed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the child? To whom does it belong?&#8221; asked Daniel.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is your own child, Daniel,&#8221; said his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;My own child! Yes, for heaven&#8217;s sakes&mdash;!&#8221; He blushed,
turned pale, looked first at his mother, and then at Eleanore.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is your own flesh and blood. Don&#8217;t you ever think of
Meta any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of Meta.... Oh, I see. And you, you adopted the child?
And you, Eleanore, knew all about this? And you, Mother, took
the child?&#8221; He sat down at the table, and covered his face with
his hands. &#8220;That was what Eleanore had in mind?&#8221; he murmured
timidly to himself. &#8220;And I presume that to make the story complete
the child&#8217;s name is Eva&nbsp;...?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Eva,&#8221; whispered Eleanore, touched by the situation. &#8220;Go
to your father, Eva, and shake hands with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The child did as it had been told. Then Marian related to
her son how Eleanore had brought the child to Eschenbach,
and how Meta had married and gone to America with her husband.</p>

<p>Every look, every movement on the part of Marian showed
how great her love for the child was: she guarded it as the apple
of her eye.</p>

<p>The circle of wonderful events closed in around Daniel&#8217;s heart.
Where responsibility lay and where guilt, where will power ended
and fate began, Daniel could not say. To express gratitude would
be vulgar; to conceal his emotions was difficult. He was ashamed
of himself in the presence of both of the women. But when he
looked at the living creature, his shame lost all meaning. And
how exalted Eleanore appeared in his eyes just then! She seemed
to him equally amiable and worthy of respect, whether he regarded
her as an active or as a sentient, feeling woman. He almost
shuddered at the thought that she was so near him; that what she
had done had been done for him filled him with humility.</p>

<p>The strangest of all, however, was little Eva herself. He
could not see enough of her; he was amazed at the trick nature
had played: a human being of the noblest mien and form had
been born of a gawky, uncouth servant girl. There was something
divinely graceful and airy about the child. She had well-formed
hands, delicate wrists, shapely ankles, and a clear, transparent
forehead, on which a network of bluish veins spread out in various
directions. Her laughter was the purest of music; and in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>walk and gestures in general there was a rhythm which promised
much for her future poise and winsomeness.</p>

<p>Daniel took Eleanore through the village and out to the old
town gate. It was the time of the annual fair; Eschenbach was
crowded. They returned on this account to the more quiet streets,
and finally entered the church. The sexton came up and admitted
Daniel to the choir. Daniel sat down at the organ; the sexton
pumped the bellows; Eleanore took a seat on one of the little
benches near the side wall.</p>

<p>Daniel&#8217;s eyes became fixed; his fingers touched the keys with
supernatural power; he began to improvise. There were two
motifs following each other in close succession; both were in fifths;
they were united into one; they ran from the low to the high
registers, from Hell through the World to Heaven. A hymn
crowned the improvised composition.</p>

<p>He stood with Eleanore for a long while in the stillness. The
songs echoed from the lofty arches. It seemed to both of them
that the blood of the one was flowing into the body of the other.
Incidents of the past faded from their memory; they seemed to
have completed a long journey; there was no voice to remind them
of their return; they were completely liberated from duties and
made immune from care.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Eleanore was to sleep with Marian and Eva; Daniel was to
have his old room. He showed it to Eleanore; they stepped to
the window and looked out. They saw Eva down in the yard
dancing back and forth barefooted on a wooden balustrade. She
kept her equilibrium by holding out her arms. The grace of
her movements was so fairy-like that Daniel and Eleanore smiled
at each other in astonishment.</p>

<p>After dinner Daniel went out in front of the house; Marian
and Eleanore sat for a while at the window; the light of the lamp
shone behind them. Later they came out into the street and
joined Daniel. Marian, however, was uneasy on account of the
child. She said that Eva had been restless all day and might cry
for her. &#8220;Stay out just as long as you like; I will leave the door
open,&#8221; she said, and went back.</p>

<p>Daniel and Eleanore returned to the fair. It was still early in
the evening, but the crowd had disappeared. They sauntered
around among the booths, and stopped to listen to the harangue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>of a mountebank or to watch peasant boys shooting at figures of
various kinds and a glass ball that danced on a jet of water. There
was a sea of red and green lanterns; sky-rockets were hissing into
the air from the rampart; musicians were playing in the caf&eacute;s,
while hilarious tipplers sang or hooted as the spirit moved them.</p>

<p>They came to a grass plot, the sole illumination of which was
the light from a circus wagon. On the steps of the wagon sat a
man in tricot holding the head of a black poodle between his
knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those were the last inhabitants of the earth,&#8221; said Daniel,
after they had crossed the square. The noise died away, the
gaudy lights disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far are you going?&#8221; asked Eleanore, without the remotest
trace of fear in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going on until I am with you,&#8221; was the quick reply.</p>

<p>The indistinct outline of a bridge became visible; under it the
water flowed noiselessly. The path had a yellowish shimmer;
there were no stars in the heavens. Suddenly the path seemed to
come to an end; at the end of it were trees there that seemed to
be moving closer and closer together; it became darker and darker;
they stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have told each other our whole story,&#8221; said Daniel. &#8220;In
the way of words we owe each other nothing. We have had
enough of talk; there has been no lack of sorrow and enough of
error. We can no longer act differently, and therefore we dare
not act differently any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be still,&#8221; whispered Eleanore, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like your wrangling;
what you say is so unpeaceful and fiendish. Yesterday I dreamed
that you were lying on your knees and had your folded hands
uplifted. Then I loved you&mdash;very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you need dreams in order to love me, girl? I don&#8217;t; I
need you just as you are. I will soon be thirty years old, Eleanore.
A man never really wakes up until he is thirty; it is then that he
conquers the world. You know what rests within me; you suspect
it. You know too how I need you; you feel it. You are my
soul; you are created out of my music; without you I am an
empty hull, a patchwork, a violin without strings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Daniel, I believe you, and yet it is not all true,&#8221; replied
Eleanore. He thought he could see in the darkness her mockingly
ironical smile: &#8220;Somewhere, I am almost tempted to say in God,
it is not true. If we were better, if we were beings in the image
of God and acting in God&#8217;s ways, we would have to desist from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>our own ways. Then it would be wonderful to live: it would be
like living above the clouds, happy, at peace, pure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does that come from your heart, Eleanore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, dear man! My heart, like yours, has been beclouded
and bewitched. I cannot give you up. I have settled my accounts.
In my soul I am entirely conscious of my guilt. I know what I
am doing and assume full responsibility for my action. There is
no use to struggle any longer; the water is already swirling over
our heads. I simply want to say that you should not delude yourself
into believing that we have risen up above other people by
what we have done, that we have deserved the gratitude of fate.
No, Daniel, what we are doing is precisely what all those do who
fall. Let me stay with you, dearest; kiss me, kiss me to death.&#8221;</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Philippina had promised Eleanore to look after Jordan and
Gertrude on Sunday.</p>

<p>As she was crossing Five Points, she went into a shop, and asked
for three pfennigs&#8217; worth of court plaster. While doing some
housework she had scratched herself on a nail. The clerk gave
her the plaster, and asked her what was the news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you poor bloke, you want to know the very latest, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221; she snarled, and then grinned with blatant self-complacency.</p>

<p>&#8220;The later the better,&#8221; said the fellow with a lustful smirk.</p>

<p>Philippina bent over the counter, and whispered: &#8220;They&#8217;re taking
their wedding trip to-day.&#8221; She laughed in a lewd, imbecile way.
The clerk stared at her with wide-opened eyes and mouth. Two
hours later the news was in the mouth of every hussy in that
section of the city.</p>

<p>Gertrude was in bed. The day woman who did the cooking
gave Philippina a plate with Jordan&#8217;s dinner on it: Meat, vegetables,
and a few sour plums. Philippina ate two of the plums on the
way up to his room, and licked her fingers.</p>

<p>The whole forenoon she spent rummaging around in Eleanore&#8217;s
room; she looked through the cabinets, the presses, and the pockets
of Eleanore&#8217;s dresses. As it began to grow dark, Jordan suddenly
entered, in hat and great coat, and looked on in speechless and
enraged amazement at the girl&#8217;s inexplicable curiosity.</p>

<p>Philippina took the broom from the corner, and began to sweep
with all her might. While sweeping she sang, out of tune, impudently,
and savagely:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;No fire, no coal, so warmly glows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As secret love that no one knows.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Jordan went away without saying anything. He had forgotten
to lock his room. Hardly had Philippina noticed that he had left
the key in the door, when she opened it and went in.</p>

<p>She spied around with cowardly, superstitious eyes. She was
afraid of the old inspector, as she would have been afraid of an
invincible magician. For such cases she had a number of formulas
at her tongue&#8217;s end. She murmured: &#8220;Put earth in, close the lid,
hold your thumbs, spit on your shoe.&#8221; She spat on her shoe.</p>

<p>She then began to examine the cabinet, for she believed that it
contained all of Jordan&#8217;s secrets. But she could not open the
lock, try as she might. She then went at the writing desk; she
was angry. There she found, in plain wooden frames, the pictures
of Gertrude and Eleanore. She ran out, got a large needle, came
back, and stuck it in the picture of Eleanore right between the eyes.
Then she took Gertrude&#8217;s picture, and after she had held it for a
while, looking at it with her gloomy eyes, she noticed that it was
spotted with blood. The plaster had come off her finger, and
the finger had started to bleed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now, Philippina,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;go and see how
Gertrude is making out.&#8221; Entering Gertrude&#8217;s room, she found
her asleep. Creeping up to her bed on her tiptoes, she took a
chair, straddled it, leaned her chin on the back, and stared fixedly
at the face of the young woman, now just barely visible in the
darkness of the room.</p>

<p>Gertrude dreamed that a black bird was hovering over her and
picking at her breast with its pointed beak. She screamed and
woke up.</p>

<p>Shortly after this Gertrude had to send for the midwife.</p>

<p>During the night, Gertrude gave birth to a girl; she had suffered
terrible pains. Philippina had seen and heard it all. She had
run back and forth, from the kitchen to the bedroom and from the
bedroom to the kitchen, for hours; she was like an insane person;
she kept mumbling something to herself. What she mumbled
no one knew.</p>

<p>Gertrude had called in vain for Daniel; in vain had she waited
for him the whole day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where in the world can Daniel be?&#8221; cried Philippina, &#8220;where
can Daniel be with his damned Eleanore?&#8221; She sat in the corner
with her hands folded, her hair tangled and knotted, her face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>distorted with the grimaces of madness. The midwife was still
busy with Gertrude; the new-born child was crying pitifully.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Daniel held the child in his arms, and looked at it carefully
but without love. &#8220;You little worm, what do you want in this
world?&#8221; he said to his daughter. He still had his hat on; so had
Eleanore. Both of them were dressed just as they came from
the station; they were embarrassed and excited at what had happened.
Eleanore was exceedingly pale; her great eyes looked
dreamy; her body seemed of almost boyish slenderness. At times
she smiled; then the smile died away, as if she did not have the
courage to appear so cheerful.</p>

<p>Inspector Jordan was also in the room, acting as he had always
acted since his bankruptcy&mdash;like a guest who feels that he is a
burden to the family. He said very humbly: &#8220;I have suggested
to Gertrude that she call the child Agnes after my deceased wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, let&#8217;s call her Agnes,&#8221; said Daniel.</p>

<p>Gertrude asked that the child be brought to her so that she
could nurse it. Eleanore carried it over and laid it at her breast.
As the hands of the sisters touched, Gertrude looked up quickly:
there was an indescribable expression of thoughtfulness, knowingness,
and kindliness on her face. Eleanore fell on her knees,
threw her arms around Gertrude&#8217;s neck, and kissed her passionately.
Gertrude reached out her left hand to Daniel; he gave her his
right hand with some hesitancy. Jordan was radiant with joy: &#8220;It
is so good, children, to see that you all love each other, so good,&#8221;
he said with visible emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel, you must move up into Father&#8217;s quarters at once,&#8221;
said Gertrude. &#8220;Your piano, bed, and all your things must be
taken up, and Eleanore will move into your room. I have already
spoken to Father about it, and he feels that it will be a good
arrangement. He will be very quiet so as not disturb you. The
crying of the baby would make it impossible for you to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a very practical solution of the problem,&#8221; said Jordan,
speaking for Daniel, and looked down at his frayed coat-sleeves,
which he tried to conceal by hiding them behind his back. &#8220;I
am also glad that Eleanore will be with you. A man, you know,
has a habit of going to bed long before a woman quits her daily
work. Is that not true, my son-in-law?&#8221; With that he clapped
Daniel on the shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;During Gertrude&#8217;s confinement I will sleep here in her room,&#8221;
said Eleanore, avoiding Daniel&#8217;s eyes as she said so. &#8220;She cannot
stay alone, and it costs too much to keep a nurse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Jordan, and went to the door. But he turned
around: &#8220;I should like to know,&#8221; he asked in a tone of great
grief, &#8220;who has been at Gertrude&#8217;s and Eleanore&#8217;s pictures. The
one is covered with spots of blood, and the other has a hole
punched in it. Isn&#8217;t that very strange? I can&#8217;t understand it:
I can&#8217;t imagine who could have done me this injury.&#8221; He shook
his head and went out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you realise that to-morrow is the first of November?&#8221;
asked Gertrude. &#8220;Have you the rent ready? Did Father make
any money last month?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he didn&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Eleanore, &#8220;but I have almost enough
to pay the landlord.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was no longer possible to depend upon Jordan. He was
supported by his children, and seemed to find the arrangement
neither strange nor humiliating. At times he would allude in a
mysterious way to a big enterprise that was going to claim the
whole of his attention and bring him a great deal of money and
honour. But if you asked him about it, he would wrinkle his
brow and put his finger to his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I owe the man more than the rent,&#8221; said Daniel. He kissed
Gertrude on the forehead, and went out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put the child in the cradle, and come over here,&#8221; said Gertrude
to Eleanore, as soon as Daniel had closed the door behind him.
Eleanore did as she had been told. The baby was asleep. She
took it up, looked at its wrinkled face, and carried it to the cradle.
Then she went over to Gertrude&#8217;s bed.</p>

<p>Gertrude seized her by her hands, and drew her down to her
with more strength than one would have imagined her to have
just then. The eyes of the two women were drawn close together.
&#8220;You must make him happy, Eleanore,&#8221; she said in a
hoarse voice, and with a sickly glimmer in her eyes. &#8220;If you do
not, it would be better if one of us were dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite her terror, Eleanore loosened Gertrude&#8217;s hold on her
with great gentleness. &#8220;It is hard to discuss that subject, Gertrude;
it is hard to live and hard to think about it all.&#8221; Eleanore
breathed these words into Gertrude&#8217;s ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must make him happy; you must make him happy! Repeat
it to yourself and keep it in your mind every day, every hour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>every minute. You must, you must, you must.&#8221; Gertrude was
almost beside herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will learn how to do it,&#8221; replied Eleanore slowly and seriously.
&#8220;I am ... I hardly know what I am or how I feel.
But be patient with me, Gertrude, I will learn how to make him
happy.&#8221; She looked into Gertrude&#8217;s face with anxious curiosity.
Gertrude however pressed her hands against Eleanore&#8217;s cheeks,
drew her down to her again, and kissed her with unusual fervour.
&#8220;I too must learn how,&#8221; whispered Gertrude, &#8220;I must learn the
whole of life from the very beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some one knocked at the door. The midwife came in to look
after her patient.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>At that time the superstition still prevailed that the window in
the room of a woman in confinement must never be opened. The
air in the room was consequently heavy and ill-smelling. Eleanore
could hardly stand it during the day; during the night she could
not sleep. Moreover natural daylight could not enter the room,
and, as if it were not already gloomy enough, the window had
been hung with green curtains which were kept half drawn.</p>

<p>The most unpleasant feature of all, however, was the interminable
round of visits from the women: custom had decreed that they
should not be turned away. The wife of the director of the
theatre came in; Martha R&uuml;bsam came in, and so did the wife of
Councillor Kirschner, and the wives of the butcher, baker, preacher,
and physician. And of course the wife of the apothecary called.
No one of them failed to pour out an abundance of gratuitous
advice or go into ecstasies over the beauty of the baby. Once
Daniel came in just as such an assemblage was in the sick room.
He looked first at one, then at another, threw back his head, and
left without saying a word.</p>

<p>Herr Seelenfromm and M. Rivi&egrave;re were likewise not frightened
by the distance; they called. Eleanore met them in the hall,
and got rid of them by the usual method. And one day even
Herr Carovius came around to inquire how mother and child were
doing. Philippina received him; and Philippina was having a hard
time of it at present: she was not allowed to enter Gertrude&#8217;s
room; Gertrude would have nothing to do with her; she refused
to see her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p><p>So that she might not get too far behind with her work&mdash;for it
meant her daily bread&mdash;Eleanore pushed the table up to the
window, and despite the poor light, kept on writing. In the
evening she would sit by the lamp and write, although she was
so tired that she could hardly keep her eyes open.</p>

<p>After three days, Gertrude had no milk for the baby; it had to
be fed with a bottle. It would cry for hours without stopping.
And as soon as it was quiet, its clothes had to be washed or its
bath prepared, or Gertrude wanted something, or one of the
pestiferous visitors came in. Eleanore had to lay her work aside;
in the evening she would fall across the bed and sleep with painful
soundness for an hour or two. If the baby did not wake her by
its hungry howling, the bad air did. Her head ached. Yet she
concealed her weakness, her longing, her oppression. Not even
Daniel noticed that there was anything wrong with her.</p>

<p>She had very little opportunity to talk with him. And yet
there was probably not another pair of eyes in the whole world
that could be so eloquent and communicative with admonition,
promise, request, and cordial resignation. One evening they met
each other at the kitchen door: &#8220;Eleanore, I am stifling,&#8221; he whispered
to her.</p>

<p>She laid her hands on his shoulder, and looked at him in
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; he urged with a stupid air. &#8220;Come with me!
Let&#8217;s run off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore smiled and thought to herself: &#8220;The demands of his soul
are always a few leagues in advance of the humanly possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning he stormed into the room. Eleanore was
only half dressed. With an expression of wrath flitting across her
face she reached for a towel and draped it about her shoulders.
He sat down on Gertrude&#8217;s bed, and let loose a torrent of words:
&#8220;I am going to set Goethe&#8217;s &#8216;Wanderers Sturmlied&#8217; to music! I
am planning to make it a companion piece to the &#8216;Harzreise&#8217; and
publish the two in a cycle. I have not slept the whole night. The
main motif is glorious.&#8221; He began to hum it over in a falsetto
voice: &#8220;&#8216;Oh, mortal man, if genius does not forsake thee, neither
rain nor storm can breathe upon thy heart!&#8217; How do you like
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude looked at him inspired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have a good drink on that idea,&#8221; he continued; &#8220;I
have rarely felt such a longing for a flask of old wine. It&#8217;s a
bloody shame that I can&#8217;t afford it. But you wait till I get a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>little money, and you will see a <i>bouteille</i> of Tokay on my table
every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, just listen how he raves! He&#8217;s going to have the
best there is,&#8221; said Philippina angrily, as she entered the room in
her stocking feet and heard Daniel&#8217;s remarks.</p>

<p>Daniel told her to keep her mouth shut and leave the room at
once. He paid no attention to her reply, and cried out: &#8220;Something
has got to happen. If I can&#8217;t drink, I at least want to
dance. Dance with me, Eleanore; don&#8217;t be afraid, come, dance
with me!&#8221; He threw his arms around her, pressed her to his
bosom, sang a waltz melody, and drew the struggling and embarrassed
girl across the floor.</p>

<p>Philippina broke out in her slimy, malicious laughter, and then
shrieked at the top of her voice that Frau Kirschner was outside
and wanted to see the Kapellmeister&#8217;s wife. Gertrude made an
imploring gesture, the full meaning of which Daniel easily grasped.
The baby began to cry, Eleanore tore herself away from Daniel&#8217;s
embrace, arranged her hair, and hastened over to the cradle.
Philippina opened the door to let the Councillor&#8217;s wife in. Just
then a violent discussion was started in the hall. One could hear
the voice of Jordan and that of some strange man.</p>

<p>It was the furniture dealer who had come to collect the money
for the cradle. He was boiling with the rage that cares not how
it may be expressed: he said he had already been there four times,
and each time he was put off. The truth is, Daniel was very
hard up.</p>

<p>The Councillor&#8217;s wife took Daniel to one side, and made him
an offer of a loan of two hundred marks. Daniel was silent; he
bit his lips, and looked down at the floor. She scolded him:
&#8220;You are always your own worst enemy. Now be reasonable,
Nothafft, I will send the money over at noon. If you have any
left, you may pay it back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel went out, and gave the blustering furniture dealer his
last ten-mark piece.</p>

<p>Frau Kirschner had brought a flask of Tokay wine with her
for Gertrude. Tokay was regarded at that time as a sort of elixir
of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, so quickly are wishes fulfilled,&#8221; said Gertrude to
Daniel in the evening, when he came into her room. She poured
out a glass for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any bills to settle?&#8221; he asked, looking partly at
Eleanore, partly at Gertrude, and striking his wallet, then bulging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>with notes. &#8220;It&#8217;s Court Councillor&#8217;s money,&#8221; he said, &#8220;real
Court Councillor&#8217;s money. How beautiful it looks, lousy fine, eh?
And upon that stuff the salvation of my soul depends!&#8221; He threw
the money on Gertrude&#8217;s bed, stuck out his tongue, and turned
away in disgust.</p>

<p>Eleanore handed him the glass of Tokay; her eyes glistened
with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Eleanore,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have trifled it away. In my arrogance
I imagined I could do something; I thought I could get
somewhere. I sit down, brood over my ideas, and find that they
are all wind-eggs. I have the feeling that I have taken a false
oath. What good am I, Eleanore, what good am I, Gertrude?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, take a drink, and perhaps your troubles will leave you,&#8221;
said Eleanore, and stroked his brow with her hand.</p>

<p>Gertrude called out to her: &#8220;Quit that! Put that glass away!&#8221;
She spoke so harshly that Eleanore sprang back, and Daniel got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me alone for a while,&#8221; she said. Daniel and Eleanore
left the room.</p>

<p>Eleanore went into the living room, sat down at the table, and
laid her head in her hands. &#8220;What can we do now?&#8221; she said
to Daniel. The violin tone in her voice had something unusually
touching about it.</p>

<p>Daniel set the candle he was carrying in the bay window. He
bent down over the table, and took Eleanore by her small wrists.
&#8220;Accept the bitter for the sake of the sweet,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Believe
in me, believe in yourself, believe in the higher law. It is
not possible that I merely imagined that there is a winged creature
for me. I must have something to cling to, something indestructible,
ah, even superhuman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have something superhuman to cling to,&#8221; Eleanore
repeated after him. She could not help but think that he had
already made superhuman demands of the other woman, his wife,
her sister, Gertrude. She raised her finger as if to warn him: it
was a gesture of infinite timidity.</p>

<p>But Daniel scarcely saw what she had done. In his arrogant
presumption and passion he could have smashed the universe to
pieces, and then re-created it merely in order to mould this one
creature after his own desires. He would have made her of
boundless pliability, and yet active in her love for him; he would
have had her spurn venerable commandments in a spirit of self-glorification,
and yet cherish unequivocal confidence in him, the
creature of need and defiance; and she would be cheerful withal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;I am cold,&#8221; whispered Eleanore, peering into the dark shadows
of the room.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>To know that these eyes and their pure passion were so close to
him; to be able to touch this cool, sincere, mutely-eloquent mouth
with his lips; to be able to hold these hands in which passion
resided as it does in the speechless unrest of a messenger; to be
able to press this throbbing figure with all its willingness and hesitation
to his bosom&mdash;it was almost too much for Daniel. It involved
pain; it aroused an impatience, a thirst for more and more.
His daily work was interrupted; his thoughts, plans, and arrangements
were torn from their connection.</p>

<p>He spoke to people whom he knew as though they were total
strangers; he amazed those whom he did not know by the loyal
confidence he voluntarily placed in them. He forgot to put on his
hat when he walked along the street; the distraction he revealed
was the source of constant merriment to passersby and on-lookers.
He would not know when it was noon; he would come home at
three o&#8217;clock, thinking it was twelve. Once he came nearly being
run over by a team of galloping horses; another time he had his
umbrella taken straight from his hands without noticing it. This
took place at the Ludwig Station.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, winged creature, winged creature,&#8221; he would say to himself,
and smile like a somnambulist. Deep in his soul a sea of
tones was surging. He listened to them with complete assurance,
angry though he would become at times because of the failure of
this or that. He was so absorbed in himself, so enmeshed in
his own thoughts, that he scarcely saw the sky above him; houses,
people, animals, and the things that are after all necessary to human
existence existed only in his dreams, if at all.</p>

<p>Winged creature, winged creature!</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>As soon as Gertrude could get up and go about, Eleanore accepted
an invitation from Martha R&uuml;bsam to visit her aunt, Frau
Seelenfromm, in Altdorf. The visit was to last two weeks.
Eleanore looked upon it as a test that would determine whether
she could do anything on her own account now: whether she could
get along without Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p><p>But she saw that she could no longer live without him. In the
lonely house she came to the conclusion that her love was great
enough to enable her to bear the monstrous burden fate had been
trying to impose upon her. She saw that neither flight nor concealment
nor anything else could save her, could save Daniel, could
give back to Gertrude what she had lost, what had been taken from
her.</p>

<p>There were times, to be sure, when she asked herself whether
it was all true and real; whether it could be possible. She walked
in darkness surrounded by demons. Her being was plunged into
the deepest and strangest bewilderment; confusion enveloped her;
there was sorrow in the effort she made to avert the inexorable.</p>

<p>But in one of her sleepless nights she thought she was covering
Daniel&#8217;s mind with a flame of fire; she thought she heard his
voice calling out to her with a power she had never known before.</p>

<p>No one she had ever seen was so vivacious, so alive as he. Her
slumbering fancy had awakened at the sound of his voice and the
feel of his warm breath. She felt that people owed him a great
deal; and since they did not seem inclined to pay their debts, it
was her duty to make restitution to Daniel for their neglect.</p>

<p>She could not survey the ways of his art: the musician in him
made neither a strange nor a special appeal to her. She grasped
and felt only him himself; to her he was Daniel. She grasped
and felt only the man who was born to do lofty, the loftiest,
deeds and who passed by the base and evil in men in silence;
who knew that he had been chosen but was obliged to renounce
the privilege of ruling; who was always in full armour, ready to
defend a threatened sanctuary.</p>

<p>Of such a man, of such a knight and warrior, she had dreamt
even when a child. For although she looked at things and circumstances
with the eyes of truth, her soul had always been full
of secret dreams and visions. Back of her unceasing and unfading
activity the genii of romanticism had been spinning their bright-coloured
threads; it was they that had formed the glass case in
which she had lived for so long, impervious to the touch of mortal
hand, immune to the flames of love.</p>

<p>The morning following that night she explained to her friend
that she was going home. Martha tried in vain to get her to stay:
she was almost ill with longing.</p>

<p>Martha let her go; she had the very saddest of thoughts concerning
Eleanore&#8217;s future; for the unhappy incidents of that unhappy
home had reached Martha&#8217;s sensitive ears. She did not worry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>because of moral principles; she was not that kind of a woman.
She worried over Eleanore out of genuine affection: it pained her
to know that she could no longer admire Eleanore.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>In the meanwhile Daniel had told his wife that a child of his
was living with his mother in Eschenbach, and that he had known
nothing about it until Eleanore took him over there. He told
her the child&#8217;s name and how old it was and who its mother was,
and gave her a detailed description of that celebrated New Year&#8217;s
Night on which he had embraced the maid. He told her how
he had stood out in front of her house that night and longed for
her with all his senses, and how he felt, when he looked at little
Eva, as if Providence had only seemed to use the body of a
strange woman, and that Eva was in reality Gertrude&#8217;s own child.</p>

<p>To this Gertrude replied: &#8220;I never want to see that child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be ashamed of having made this remark once you do
see the child,&#8221; replied Daniel. &#8220;You should not be envious of a
creature whom God brought into the world so that the world may be
more beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak of God!&#8221; said Gertrude quickly and with uplifted
hand. Then, after a pause, during which Daniel looked at her
angrily, she added with a painful smile: &#8220;The very idea: I, jealous,
envious! O no, Daniel.&#8221;</p>

<p>The way she pressed her hands to her bosom convinced Daniel,
and quite emphatically too, that she did not know the feeling of
envy or jealousy. He said nothing, but remained in her room for
an unusually long while. When she was cutting bread, she let the
knife fall. He sprang and picked it up for her. He had never
done this before. Gertrude looked at him as he bent over. Her
eyes became dim, flared up, and then became dim again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak of God!&#8221; Somehow Daniel could not get these
words out of his mind.</p>

<p>When Eleanore returned she was terrified at the expression on
Daniel&#8217;s face. He seemed dazed; his eyes were inflamed as though
he too had not been able to sleep; he could hardly talk. Finally
he demanded that she swear to him never to go away again.</p>

<p>She hesitated to take an oath of this kind, but he became more
and more insistent, and she took it. He threw his arms about her
with passionate impetuosity; just then the door opened, and
Gertrude stood on the threshold. Daniel hastened to her, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>wanted to take her by the hand; but she stepped back and back
until she reached her bedroom.</p>

<p>It was evening; covers were laid for four: Jordan was to take
dinner with them that evening. He came down promptly; Eleanore
brought in the food; but Gertrude was nowhere to be found.
Eleanore went in to her. She was sitting by the cradle, combing
her hair with slow deliberation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you eat with us, Gertrude?&#8221; asked Eleanore.</p>

<p>Gertrude did not seem to hear her. In a few minutes she got
up, walked over to the mirror on the wall, pressed her hair with
the palms of her hands to her two cheeks, and looked in the mirror
with wide-opened eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Gertrude,&#8221; said Eleanore, rather timidly, &#8220;Daniel is
waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That they are in there again,&#8221; murmured Gertrude, &#8220;it seems
like a sin.&#8221; She turned around, and beckoned to Eleanore.</p>

<p>Eleanore went over to her in perfect obedience. Gertrude
threw her arms around her neck until her left temple touched
Eleanore&#8217;s right one with only her hair hanging between them
like a curtain. Gertrude again looked in the mirror; her eyes
became rigid; she said: &#8220;Oh yes, you are more beautiful, much
more beautiful, a hundred times more beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the child began to stir, and since Gertrude was still
standing immovable before the mirror, Eleanore went to the
cradle. Hardly had Gertrude noticed what she had done, when
she rushed out and cried with terrifying rudeness: &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch
that child! Don&#8217;t touch it, I say!&#8221; She then went up, snatched
the child from the cradle, and went back to her bed with it,
saying gently and yet threateningly: &#8220;It belongs to me, to me and
to no one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since this incident, Eleanore knew that a fearful change had
come over her sister. She did not know whether other people
noticed it; she did not even know whether Daniel was aware of
it. But she knew it, and it frightened her.</p>

<p>One afternoon, about sunset, Eleanore came in and found Gertrude
on her knees in the hall scrubbing the floor. &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t
do that, Gertrude,&#8221; said Eleanore, &#8220;you are not strong enough for
that kind of work yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude made no reply; she kept on scrubbing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you dress better?&#8221; continued Eleanore; &#8220;Daniel
does not like to see you going about in that ugly old brown skirt.
Believe me, it makes him angry.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p><p>Gertrude straightened up on her knees, and said with disconcerting
humility: &#8220;You dress up; it is not well for two to look
so nice. What shall I do?&#8221; she asked, and let her head sink.
&#8220;You wear your gold chain and the corals in your ears. That
pleases me; that is the way it should be. But I have no gold
chain; I have no corals. If I had them, I wouldn&#8217;t wear them;
and if I wore them, it would not be right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Gertrude, what are you talking about?&#8221; asked Eleanore.</p>

<p>The ringing of the church bells could be heard in the hall.
Gertrude folded her hands in prayer. There was a stern solemnity
in her action. In her kneeling position she looked as though
she were petrified.</p>

<p>Eleanore went into the room with a heavy heart.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>Through the dividing walls Daniel and Eleanore were irresistibly
drawn to each other. They accompanied each other in
their thoughts; each divined the other&#8217;s wishes and feelings. If
he came home in a bad humour, if she was anxious and restless,
they both needed merely to sit down by each other to regain their
peace.</p>

<p>If Daniel&#8217;s power of persuasion was great, Eleanore&#8217;s example
was equally great. A dish would displease Daniel. Eleanore
would not only eat it, but would praise it; and Daniel would then
eat it too, and like it. Gertrude had prepared the food, and
Eleanore felt it was her duty to spare her sister as much humiliation
as possible. But Gertrude did not want to be treated indulgently.
She would lay her knife and fork aside, and say: &#8220;Daniel
is right. It is not fit to eat.&#8221; She would get up and go into the
kitchen and make a porridge that would take the place of the
inedible dish. That was the way she acted: she was always resigned,
diligent, and quiet; she made every possible effort to do
her duty. Daniel and Eleanore looked at each other embarrassed;
but their embarrassment was transformed in time into mutual
ecstasy: they could not keep from looking at each other.</p>

<p>There was nothing of the seducer in Daniel&#8217;s sexual equipment.
On the other hand he was dependent to a very high degree
upon his wishes and desires; and in his passionate obstinacy he not
infrequently lacked consideration. Eleanore however possessed profound
calmness, cheerful certainty, and a goodly measure of indulgence;
and she knew exactly how to make use of these traits. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>claims that were made on her patience and moderation would have
harassed a heart steeled in the actualities of politics and flooded
with worldly experiences. She however found a safe and unerring
guide in the instincts of her nature, and was never tired.</p>

<p>The trait in her to which he took most frequent and violent
exception was what he called her plebeian caution; she seemed
determined to pay due and conventional respect to appearances.
He did not wish to lay claim to the hours of his love as though
they were a stolen possession; he did not wish to sneak across
bridges and through halls; he did not wish to whisper; he did not
wish to lie in wait for a secret tryst; he rebelled at the thought of
coming and going in fear and trembling.</p>

<p>There is not the slightest use to investigate all the secrecies between
Daniel and Eleanore. It will serve no useful end to infringe
with unskilled hand on the work of the evil spirit Asmodeus,
who makes walls transparent and allows his devotees to look into
bed chambers. It would be futile to act as the spy of Daniel and
show how he left the attic room in the dead of night and crept
down the stairs in felt slippers. We have no desire to hear of
Eleanore&#8217;s pangs of conscience and her longings, her flights, her
waiting in burning suspense; to relate how she endeavoured to
avert the inevitable to-day and succumbed to-morrow would be
to tell an idle tale. It is best to overlook all these things; to
draw a curtain of mercy before them; for they are so human and
so wholly without a trace of the miraculous.</p>

<p>It will be enough to touch upon a single night on which Daniel
went to Eleanore&#8217;s room and said: &#8220;I have never yet seen you as a
lover sees his beloved.&#8221; Eleanore was sitting on the edge of her
bed, trembling. She blew out the candle. Daniel heard the
rustling of her clothes. She went up to the stove and opened the
front draft door. There was a red hot coal fire in the stove.
She stood before him with the purple glow of the burning coals
upon her body, slender, delicate, nude. Her figure, peculiarly
beautiful, was filled with the most harmonious of inspiration; it
was ensouled. And since the play of her limbs, as they became
conscious of the light, was suddenly stiffened with shame, Eleanore
bent her head over to the wall where the mask of Zingarella,
which he had given her, was hanging. She took it down, and
held it with both hands so that the purple glow from the stove fell
also on it. As she did this she smiled in a way that cut Daniel
to the very heart: something eternal came over him; he had a
premonition of the end; he feared fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p><p>At the same time Gertrude rose up in her bed, and stared with
eyes as if she were beholding, who knows whom? at the door.
After she had stared for a long while, she got up, opened the door,
went out into the hall without making the slightest noise, came
back, went out again, came back again, and got in bed, left the
door open, sat upright and gazed at the closed door across the hall
behind which she knew Daniel and Eleanore were. Her hair
hung down in two long braids on either side of her head. Her
pale face in this frame of black hair above it and on both sides of
it looked like a wax figure in an old black frame.</p>

<p>Of the pictures that were being formed in her mind and soul,
there was not a single twitching of the muscles to indicate what
they looked like.</p>

<p>For her the entire world lay behind that door. It seemed to
her that she could no longer endure the knowledge she had of
what was taking place. In her maddened imagination she saw
women stealing through the halls of the house; in every corner
there was a woman, and with every woman there was a man; they
embraced each other, and sank their teeth into each other&#8217;s flesh. It
was all as criminal as it was irrational; it was a shame and an
abomination to behold. Everywhere she looked she saw reprehensible
nudeness; all clothes seemed to be made of glass; she
could look neither at a man nor at a woman without turning pale.
She had only one refuge: the cradle of her child. She would
rush to it and pray. But as soon as her prayer was ended she
again felt stifled in the poisoned air about her, while the desire
to acquit herself of the crime of which she felt guilty, unable
though she was to define the crime or determine her part in it,
robbed her of her sleep. She felt that a great jagged stone was
suspended over her head, that it was becoming less and less firmly
attached every day, and that its fall if not imminent was
certain.</p>

<p>Hour after hour passed by; Daniel finally appeared in the
vestibule. He was not a little terrified when he saw the burning
lamp and Gertrude sitting up in bed.</p>

<p>He went into the bedroom, closed the door, walked up to the
cradle, looked at the child, and then went over to Gertrude. She
cast a glance of infinite inquiry at him. It was a look that seemed
to implore him for a decision, a judgment. At the same time she
put out her hands as if to ward off any approach on his part.
When she saw that he was astonished, she softened the expression
on her face, and said: &#8220;Give me your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p><p>She took his right hand, stroked it, and whispered: &#8220;Poor hand,
poor hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel bit his lips: &#8220;Oh woman, what&nbsp;...?&#8221; That was all.</p>

<p>He sat down in silence on the edge of her bed. Gertrude looked
at him in the same tense, anxious way in which she had studied
him a few moments earlier. He sank down beside her, and fell
asleep with his head on her breast.</p>

<p>She kept on holding his hand. She looked into his pale, narrow
face and at his angular brow, the skin of which could be seen to
twitch every now and then under the loose flowing hair that hung
over it. The oil in the lamp was getting low, the wick had
begun to smell. She was afraid however to put it out lest she
might waken Daniel. She looked on in silence as the light became
dimmer and dimmer and finally went out, leaving only the red
glow of the wick. This too died away in time, and it became dark.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>For some time Eleanore had noticed that the baker&#8217;s boy, instead
of carefully putting the rolls in the sack each morning as had
always been his custom, threw them through the lattice on to the
ground.</p>

<p>The newspaper boy stopped speaking to her; the postman smiled
scornfully; and even the beggar, at least she thought so, asked for
his alms in a tone of impudence.</p>

<p>One day she was passing through Schmausen Street; a woman
was leaning out of the window. Seeing Eleanore coming, she
called back into the room, whereupon a young man and three half-grown
girls rushed to the window, began making remarks to each
other, and gaped at her with looks that made her turn deathly
pale.</p>

<p>Another time Daniel brought her a free ticket to a concert.
She went, and as soon as she reached the hall she was struck by
the discourteous and indecent manner in which the bystanders
looked at her. A well-dressed woman moved away from her.
Some men kept walking around her, grinning at her. She found
it intolerable, and went home.</p>

<p>Exercise in the open had often driven away the cares that
chanced to be weighing upon her: she went skating. As soon as
the people saw her, they began to whisper among themselves. She
did not bother about them or their remarks; she cut her beautiful
figures on the ice as if she were quite alone. A group of young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>girls pointed at her with their fingers. She went up to them with
pride glistening in her eyes, and they all ran away. Those who
had formerly paid homage to her avoided her now. Her soul
rebelled within her; meeting with so much unexpected and cowardly
vulgarity enflamed her sensibilities and ennobled her self-respect.</p>

<p>One day in December she crossed the Wine Market, and started
to pass through a narrow street that led to the Halle Gate. Standing
at the entrance to the alley were a number of men engaged in
conversation. She recognised Alfons Diruf among them. She
thought they would step to one side and let her pass, but not one
of them moved. They gaped at her in unmitigated shamelessness.
She could have turned about and taken another street, but that
defiance on the part of those men made her insist upon her rights
to go the way she had originally decided upon. Impressed, apparently,
by the flaming blue of her eyes, the scoundrels at last condescended
to shift their lazy frames to one side. They formed
an espalier through which she had to walk. But worse than this
were the lewd looks that she knew were following her, and the
laughter that greeted her ears. It was the type of laughter ordinarily
heard at night when one passes a low dive, in which the
scum of human society has gathered to amuse itself by the telling
of salacious stories.</p>

<p>She often had the feeling, particularly after dark, that some
one was following her. Once she looked around, and a man was
behind her. He wore a havelock; he turned quickly into a gate.
A few days later she had a similar experience, but this time she
was frightened worse than ever, for she thought it was Herr
Carovius.</p>

<p>One evening as she was leaving the house she saw the same
figure standing by the church on the other side of the street. As
she hesitated and wondered whether she should go on, another
person joined the first. She thought it was Philippina. The two
began to talk, but Eleanore could not make out who they were; it
was snowing, and there was no street lamp nearby.</p>

<p>She could not tell why, but she was suddenly seized with
anxiety for Daniel; for him and for no one else. She felt that
unless she went back something dreadful would happen to him.
She rushed up the steps to the attic room, and knocked at his
door; there was not a sound. She opened the door and went in,
but everything was dark. In the darkness, however, standing out
against the white background from the light of the snow, she saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>his body. He was sitting at the piano; he had his arms on the lid,
his head between his hands. Eleanore hastened up to him, and,
with a tone of sweet sadness in what she said, threw her arms
around his neck.</p>

<p>Daniel took her on his lap, pressed her head to his bosom, and
laughed with open month and shining teeth but without making
a sound. He often laughed that way now.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>He laughed that way at the intrigues that were being forged
against him by his bitterest enemy, Fr&auml;ulein Varini, and which
resulted in his meeting with distrust and opposition in everything
he undertook at the City Theatre.</p>

<p>He laughed that way at the anonymous letters, filled with insulting
remarks, which were being sent him by his fellow citizens,
and which he read with na&iuml;ve curiosity merely to see how far
human nastiness and bestial hate could go.</p>

<p>He laughed that way when he received the letter from Baroness
von Auffenberg informing him that she was forced to discontinue
her lessons and recitals. She said that her constitution had been
weakened, and that she was going to close her town house and spend
the winter at her country place at Hersbruck. Daniel heard however
that she spent a great deal of her time in town, and that she
had arranged for an elaborate cycle of <i>musicales</i>, a thing she had
never dared to do under his administration. Andreas D&ouml;derlein
had been engaged as her musical adviser: now she could rave and
go into ecstasies and hypnotise her impotent soul in the mephitic
air of artificial aroma just as much as she pleased.</p>

<p>And he laughed that way at the weekly attacks upon him and
his art that appeared in the <i>Fr&auml;nkischer Herold</i>, copies of which
were delivered at his front door with the regularity of the sun.
The attacks consisted of sly, caustic sneers, secrets that had been
ferreted out with dog-like keenness, gigantic broadsides based on
hearsay evidence, and perfidious suspicions lodged against Daniel
Nothafft, the artist, and Daniel Nothafft, the man.</p>

<p>The articles never failed to mention the Goose Man. Daniel
asked to have the allusion explained. The Goose Man was elevated
to the rank and dignity of an original humourist. &#8220;What is the
latest concerning the Goose Man?&#8221; became a standing head-line.
Or the reader&#8217;s eye would fall on the following notice: &#8220;The
Goose Man is again attracting the attention of all friends of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>music. He has had the ingenious audacity to make the opera
&#8216;Stradella&#8217; more enjoyable by the interpolation of a funeral march
of his own make. The ever-submissive domestic birds which he
carries under his arms have rewarded him for his efforts in this
connection by the cackling of their abundant and affectionate gratitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>The birthplace of these inimitable achievements in the field of
journalistic wit was the reserved table at the Crocodile. If ever
in the history of the world men have laughed real honest tears
it was at the writing of such news bearing on the life and conduct
of the Goose Man. The editor-in-chief, Weibezahl, was the
recording secretary at these intellectual Olympiads, and Herr
Carovius was the protagonist. He had access to reliable sources,
as newspaper men say, and every evening he surprised the round
table with new delicacies for Weibezahl&#8217;s columns.</p>

<p>Daniel was ignorant of what was going on. But the Goose
Man, the expression as well as the figure, became interwoven with
his thoughts, and acquired, somehow and somewhere in the course
of time, a transfigured meaning.</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>One day Frau Kirschner wrote to Daniel telling him that she
did not wish to have anything more to do with him; she demanded
in the same letter that he pay back the money she had advanced
him. He could not raise it: the City Theatre had already made
him a loan, he had no friends, and M. Rivi&egrave;re, the only person
on earth who might have been able to come to his rescue, had
gone back to France.</p>

<p>Matters took their usual course: A lawyer notified Daniel, giving
him so many days grace; when these had elapsed and no payment
had been made, a summons was served on him; the sheriff came in,
and in default of any other object of value he pawned the piano.</p>

<p>Daniel&#8217;s objections were quite ineffectual: a few days more and
the piano would be put up at auction.</p>

<p>One gloomy morning in January Philippina entered his room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Daniel,&#8221; she began, &#8220;would you like to have some money
from me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel turned his head slowly and looked at her in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have lots of it,&#8221; she continued with her hoarse voice, her
glassy eyes glittering underneath her bangs. &#8220;I have been saving
it a pfennig at a time ever since I was a child. I can give you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>the money you owe the Councillor&#8217;s wife. Sling it at her, the
old hag! Say to me: &#8216;Please Philippina, give me the money,&#8217; and
you&#8217;ll find it on the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you crazy?&#8221; asked Daniel, &#8220;get out of here just as quickly
as your feet can carry you!&#8221; He felt distinctly creepy in her
presence.</p>

<p>Philippina, beside herself with rage, seized his hand. Before
he could do a thing she bit him just below the little finger. The
wound was quite deep. He groaned, shook her off, and pushed
her back. She looked at him triumphantly, but her face had
turned yellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Daniel,&#8221; she said in a begging, beseeching tone,
&#8220;don&#8217;t be so ugly! Don&#8217;t be so mean toward me! Don&#8217;t be so
jealous!&#8221;</p>

<p>The wench&#8217;s infamous smile, her hair hanging down over her
eyes, her big red hands, the snow-flakes on her short cloak, the
border on her fiery red dress below her cloak, and the poison
green ribbon on her hat&mdash;this ensemble of ugliness filled Daniel
with the loathing he might have experienced had he stood face to
face with the most detestable picture he had ever seen from the
world of human beings. But as he turned his head, a feeling of
sympathy came over him; he suspected that the girl was bound
to him by bonds that did not reach him until after they had
taken their course through the dark channels of some subterranean
labyrinth. What she had done filled him with dismay; but as a
revelation of character it surprised him and set him to thinking.</p>

<p>He went over to the washing table to put his bleeding hand
in the water. Philippina took a fresh handkerchief from the
cabinet, and handed it to him as a bandage. He looked at her
with piercing eyes, and said: &#8220;What kind of a person are you?
What sort of a devil is in you, anyway? Be careful, Jason Philip&#8217;s
daughter, be careful!&#8221;</p>

<p>Since there was a tone of kindness in these words, the muscles
of Philippina&#8217;s face moved in a mysterious way. Her features
were distorted as if by a grin, and yet she was not grinning. She
drew a leather purse from her cloak pocket, opened it, and took
out two one-hundred-mark notes and a gold coin. They had been
wrapped in paper. She unfolded the paper and the notes, laid
them, together with the coin, on the table, and handed Daniel a
written statement.</p>

<p>He read it: &#8220;I, the undersigned, Daniel Nothafft, promise to pay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>to Philippina Schimmelweis two hundred and twenty marks at
five per cent interest, for value received.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With that you c&#8217;n pay the sheriff and git yourself out of this
mess,&#8221; said Philippina, in a most urgent tone. &#8220;You can&#8217;t give
piano lessons on a rolling pin, and that music box of yours is after
all the tool you make your living by. Sign that, and you will
be in peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get the money?&#8221; asked Daniel. &#8220;How did
you ever come by so much money? Tell me the truth.&#8221; All of
a sudden he remembered Theresa&#8217;s words: &#8220;All that nice money,
all that nice money!&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina began to chew her finger nails. &#8220;That&#8217;s none of
your business,&#8221; she said gruffly, &#8220;it ain&#8217;t been stolen. Moreover,
I c&#8217;n tell you,&#8221; she said, as she felt that his distrust was taking on
a threatening aspect, &#8220;mother give it to me on the sly. She
didn&#8217;t want me to be without a penny if anything happened. For
my father&mdash;he would like to see me strung up. She give it to me,
I say, on the side, and she made me swear before the cross that I
would never let any one know about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This tale of horror made Daniel shake his head; he had his
doubts. He felt she was lying, and yet there was a mysterious
force back of her statement and in her eyes. He was undecided;
he thought it over. His livelihood was at stake. Weeks, months
might pass by before he could get another piano. Philippina&#8217;s
readiness to help him was a riddle to him, everything she said was
repulsive and banal; but after all she was willing to help in a most
substantial way, and he was in such difficulties that voices of
admonition simply had to be drowned out.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing but money,&#8221; he thought contemptuously, and
sat down to put his name to the note.</p>

<p>Philippina drew up her shoulders, and never once breathed until
he had signed the note and handed it over to her in silence. Then
she looked at him imploringly, and said: &#8220;Now Daniel, you must
never again treat me like you would a scurvy cat.&#8221;</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>There had been an unusual amount of talk this year about the
parade on Shrove Tuesday. On the afternoon of that day the
whole city was on its feet.</p>

<p>Daniel was on his way home; he had reached the corner of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>Theresa Street when he ran into the crowd. He stopped out of
idle curiosity. The first division of the parade came up: it consisted
of three heralds in gaudy medi&aelig;val costumes, and back of
them were three councillors on horseback.</p>

<p>Next in the procession was a condemned witch on a wheelbarrow.
Her face had been hideously painted, and in her hand
she swung a huge whiskey bottle. She was followed by a group
of Chinese, each with a long pigtail, and they by a troupe of
dancing Kameruns.</p>

<p>The procession moved on in the following order: a giant carrying
twenty-seven quart beer mugs; a woman&#8217;s orchestra consisting
exclusively of old women; a wagon from one of the peasant districts
bearing the inscription, &#8220;Adorers of Taxes&#8221;; a smoking club
with the Swedish match merchant; a wagon with a replica of the
Spittler Gate made of beer kegs; the so-called guard against
sparks; a nurse with a grown child in diapers and Hussar boots;
the seven Swabians on velocipedes; a cabriolet with a gaily dressed
English family; a conveyance carrying authors. There were two
inscriptions on it: &#8220;The And So Forths&#8221; and &#8220;The Et Ceterists.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the end of the procession was a wagon with a skilful imitation
of the Goose Man. It had been made out of old boards,
hoops, clay, old rags, and iron. The Goose Man himself wore
an open velvet doublet and short velvet trousers, from the pockets
of which protruded rolls of banknotes. Instead of a cap he had
a rusty pan on his head, and on his feet was a pair of worn
patent leather shoes. Under each arm he carried a goose. The
geese had been made of dough. Their heads were not the heads
of geese but of women artificially painted and with so-called taws,
or marbles, for their eyes. The face at the Goose Man&#8217;s left
looked melancholy, the one at his right was cheerful.</p>

<p>This was the centre of attraction; it was surrounded by the
largest crowds. Every time it came within sight of a fresh group
of on-lookers there was a tremendous shouting and waving of flags.
This was true even where it was plain that the people did not
appreciate the significance of it. Pulchinellos brandished their
wooden swords, Indian chieftains danced around it screaming their
mighty war-whoops, a Mephistopheles turned somersaults, knights
mounted on stilts saluted, and children with wax masks shrieked
until it was impossible to hear one&#8217;s own voice.</p>

<p>Daniel had watched the performance with relative indifference.
He had regarded it merely as a display of commonplace ability
to amuse the people. Then came the wagon with the imitation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>of the Goose Man. On it stood Schwalbe the sculptor, gloriously
drunk. Beside him stood Kropotkin the painter in his shirt
sleeves, apparently oblivious to the fact that it was cold. A fearfully
fat youth&mdash;a future school officer, so far as could be determined
from his looks&mdash;had hit upon the happy idea of pasting
the title of the <i>Fr&auml;nkischer Herold</i> to the Goose Man&#8217;s hat. This
took the initiated by storm.</p>

<p>Kropotkin recognised Daniel. He called to him, threw him
kisses, had one of the wooden swords given him, and went through
the motion of directing an orchestra. The fat boy hurled a handful
of pretzels at the spot on the sidewalk where Daniel was
standing; a trombone began to bray; the Englishman first stuck
his head out of his cabriolet, and then got out and hopped over to
Daniel, carrying a pole draped with women&#8217;s clothes, including
a feather hat and a veil. A new keg of beer was tapped on the
Gambrinus wagon, while the people in the houses rushed to the
windows and roared.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have forgotten the railing,&#8221; cried Daniel in a loud voice
to the people on the Goose Man wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; they asked, and looked at each other in
astonishment. The on-lookers were filled with curious silence:
many of them gazed at Daniel, bewildered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forgot the railing,&#8221; he repeated, with glistening eyes,
&#8220;you have forgotten the iron railing. Without his protection the
poor Goose Man is to be sure your buffoon, your zany, your
clown.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed quietly, and, with opened mouth and shining teeth,
quickly withdrew from the innumerable gapers. Having reached
a deserted alley, he began to sing with a frenzied expression on
his face: &#8220;Whom thou dost not desert, oh Genius, him wilt thou
raise up with wings of fire. He will wander on as if with feet of
flowers across Deucalion&#8217;s seas of slime, killing Python, light-footed,
famed Pythius Apollo.&#8221;</p>


<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>A few weeks later a real singer came to Daniel. She sang
several of the songs he had written. He had thought they were
completely forgotten by everybody. Her art was not merely perfect;
it was wonderful.</p>

<p>It was a very mysterious visit the singer paid him. One afternoon
during a fearful snow storm the bell rang; and when Gertrude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>opened the door, she saw a woman wearing a heavy black veil
standing before her, who said she wished to speak to Kapellmeister
Nothafft. Gertrude took her up to Daniel&#8217;s room. The stranger
told Daniel she had been wishing to make his acquaintance for a
long time, and, now on her way to Italy, she had been detained
in the city for a few days by the illness of a near friend. This,
she said, she regarded as a hint from fate itself. She had come
to extend him her greetings, and particularly to thank him for his
songs, a copy of which a friend had been good enough to present
to her at a time when she was living under the weight of a great
sorrow.</p>

<p>She spoke with an accent that had a Northern note in it, but
easily and fluently; she gave the impression of a woman who had
seen a great deal of the world and had profited by her travels.
Daniel asked her with whom he had the pleasure of speaking, but
she smiled, and asked permission to conceal her name for the
present. She said that it really did not make much difference,
and that it might be more agreeable to him later to think that an
unknown woman had come to him to express her appreciation than
to recall that Fr&auml;ulein So-and-So had been there: she hoped that
her very anonymity would make a more lasting impression on his
memory than could be made by a woman of whom he knew only
what everybody knows.</p>

<p>The mingling of the jocose and the serious, of the mind and
the heart, in the words of the stranger pleased Daniel. Though
his replies were curt and cool, it was plain that she was affording
him much pleasure: she was reminding him of the fact that his
creations had not after all sunk into an echoless abyss. In course
of time, the conversation turned again to the songs; she said she
would like very much to sing some of them for him. Daniel was
pleased. He got the score, sat down at the piano, and the enigmatic
woman began to sing. At the very first note Daniel was
enraptured; he had never heard such a voice: so soft, so pure, so
emotional, so unlike the conventional product of the conservatory.
As soon as she had finished the first song, he looked up at her in
unaffected embarrassment, and murmured: &#8220;Who are you, anyhow?
Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No investigations or cross-questioning, please,&#8221; replied the
singer, and, blushing at the praise Daniel was bestowing on her
by his very behaviour, she laughed and said, &#8220;The next song,
please, that one by Eichendorff!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude, who had not wished to remain longer than was necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>because of the unkempt impression she knew she made, had
hastened down to the kitchen. And now Eleanore came in, after
having knocked at the door with all imaginable timidity. She had
heard the strange voice, had rushed out into the hall, and, unable
to restrain her curiosity any longer, had come in to see the
singer.</p>

<p>Daniel nodded to her with radiant eyes, the stranger greeted
her cordially though calmly, and then began to sing the next song;
after this she took up the third, and so on until she had sung
the complete cycle of six. Old Jordan was standing behind the
door; he had his hands pressed to his face and was listening; he
was much moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I must be going,&#8221; said the strange woman, after she had
finished the last song. She shook hands with Daniel, and said:
&#8220;It has been a beautiful hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been one of the most beautiful hours I have ever experienced,&#8221;
said Daniel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>The strange woman went away, leaving behind her not a trace
of anything other than the memory of a joy that grew more
fabulous as the storm-tossed years rolled by. Daniel never saw
her again, and never heard from her again.</p>


<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>While the woman was singing, Gertrude had been standing down
in the hall listening. She knew every note of every song; every
melody in the accompaniment seemed to her like an old, familiar
picture. She was also aware that an artist by the grace of God
had been in the house.</p>

<p>But how strange it was that she should find nothing unusual in
the incident. She felt that a living stream in her bosom had dried
up, leaving nothing but sand and stones in its bed. This inability
to feel, this being dead to all sensations, took the form of excruciating
pangs of conscience.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, my God, what has happened to me?&#8221; she sighed,
and wrung her hands.</p>

<p>That evening she went to the Church of Our Lady, and prayed
for a long while. Her prayer did not appease her, however; she
came back home more disquieted than ever.</p>

<p>The door of the living room was open: Daniel and Eleanore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>were sitting by the lamp, reading together from a book. The
baby began to move; Eleanore had left the door open so that she
might be able to hear the child when it woke up. Gertrude took
the child in her arms, quieted it, and returned to the door leading
into the living room. Daniel and Eleanore had turned their backs
to the door, and were so absorbed in their reading that they were
not aware of Gertrude&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p>A light suddenly came into Gertrude&#8217;s heart: she became conscious
of her guilt&mdash;the guilt she had been trying in vain to
fathom now for so many cruel weeks.</p>

<p>She did not have enough of the power of love; therein lay her
guilt. She had assumed an obligation that was quite beyond her
power to fulfil: she had entered into marriage without having
the requisite strength of heart.</p>

<p>Marriage had seemed to her like the Holy of Holies. Her
union with the man she loved seemed to her to be of equal
significance with the union with God. But when she saw that
this bond had been broken, the world was plunged into an abyss
immeasurably remote from God. And it was not her husband
who seemed to her to be guilty of infidelity; nor did she look
upon her sister as being the guilty one; it was she herself who had
been unfaithful and guilty in their eyes. She had not stood the
test; she had been tried and found wanting; her strength had not
been equal to her presumptions; God had rejected her. This
conviction became irrevocably rooted in her heart.</p>

<p>In her union with Daniel music had become something divine;
and she saw, now this union had been broken, something in music
that was perilous, something that was to be avoided: she understood
why she was so unemotional, why her feelings had dried up and
vanished.</p>

<p>But she wanted to make one more effort to see whether she
was entirely right in the analysis of her soul. One morning she
went to Daniel, and asked him to play a certain passage from the
&#8220;Harzreise.&#8221; She said she would like to hear the close of the
slow middle movement which had always made such an appeal to
her. Her request was made in such an urgent, anxious tone that
Daniel granted it, though he did not feel like playing. As
Gertrude listened, she became paler and paler: her diagnosis was
being corroborated with fearful exactness. What had once been
a source of ecstasy was now the cause of intense torture. The
tones and harmonies seemed to be eating into her very soul; the
pain she felt was so overwhelming, that it was only with the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>exertion that she mustered up sufficient self-control to leave the
room unaided. Daniel was dismayed.</p>

<p>On her return to the kitchen, Gertrude heard a most peculiar
noise in her bedroom. She went in only to see that little Agnes
had crept into the corner of the room where the harp stood, and
was striking the strings with a copper spoon, highly pleased with
her actions. Gertrude was seized with a vague, nameless terror.
She took the harp into the kitchen, removed the strings from the
frame, rolled them up, put them in a drawer, and carried the
stringless frame up to the attic.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221; she whispered to herself, and looked around
in the attic with an expression of complete helplessness. She
longed for peace, and it seemed peaceful up where she was. She
stayed a while, leaning up against one of the beams, her eyes
closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221; That was the question she put to herself
day and night. &#8220;I can no longer be of any help to my husband;
to stand in his way merely because of the child is not right.&#8221;
Such was the trend of her argument. She saw how he was suffering,
how Eleanore was suffering, how each was suffering on account
of the other, and how both were suffering because of the despicable
vulgarity of the human race. She thought to herself that if
she were not living, everything would be right. She imagined,
indeed she was certain, that all the truth he had given her had
had the sole purpose of whitewashing a lie, by which she was to
be made to believe that her existence was a necessity to him. She
was convinced that the weight of this lie was crushing the very
life out of him. She wished to free him from it and its consequences.
But how she was to do this she did not know. She
knew that if Daniel and Eleanore could belong to each other in a
legal, legitimate way, they would be vindicated in the eyes of God
and man. But how this was to be brought about she did not
know.</p>

<p>She sought and sought for a way out. Her ideas were vague
but persistent. She felt that she was running around in a circle,
unable to do more than stare at the centre of the circle. Every
morning at five o&#8217;clock she would get up and go to church. She
prayed with a devotion and passion that physically exhausted her
heart.</p>

<p>One morning she knelt before the altar in unusually heart-rending
despair. She thought she heard a small voice crying out
to her and telling her to take her life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p><p>She swooned; people rushed up to her, and wet her forehead
with cold water. This enabled her to get up and go home. A
peculiarly sorrowful and dreamy expression lay on her face.</p>

<p>She wanted to do some knitting, for she recalled that when she
was a girl she was always able to dispel care and grief by knitting.
But every stitch she made turned into the cry: &#8220;You must take
your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knelt down by the cradle of little Agnes, but the child
said to her only too distinctly: &#8220;Mother, you must take your
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore came in. On her brow was the light of enjoyed
happiness; her whole body was happiness; her lips trembled and
twitched with happiness. But her eyes said. &#8220;Sister, you must take
your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina stood by the kitchen stove, and whispered to the
coals: &#8220;Gertrude, you must take your life.&#8221; Her father came in,
got his dinner, expressed his thanks for it, and went out murmuring,
&#8220;Daughter, you must take your life; believe me, it will be
for the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>If she passed by the well, something drew her to the edge; voices
called to her from the depths. From every beaker she put to her
lips to drink shone forth her image as if from beyond the tomb.
On Sunday she climbed up the Vestner Tower, and let her eyes
roam over the plains below as if in the grief of departure. She
leaned forward out of the little window with a feeling of assuaging
horror. The keeper, seeing what she was doing, rushed up,
seized her arms, and made her get back.</p>

<p>If the cock crew, it was the crow of death; if the clock ticked,
it was the tick of death; if the wind blew, it was a breath from
beyond the grave. &#8220;You must take your life&#8221;&mdash;with this thought
the air, the earth, the house, the church, the morning, the evening,
and her dreams were full.</p>

<p>In April Eleanore was taken down with fever. Gertrude watched
by her bedside night and day; she sacrificed herself. Daniel,
worried about Eleanore, went around in a dazed condition. When
he came to her bed he never noticed Gertrude. After Eleanore
had begun to recover, Gertrude lay down; for she was very tired.
But she could not sleep; she got up again.</p>

<p>She went into the kitchen in her bare feet, though she did not
know why she went. It was the consuming restlessness of her
heart that drove her from her bed. Her legs were heavy with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>exhaustion, but she did not like to stay in any one place for any
length of time. Later Daniel came back from the city, and
brought her a silver buckle which he fastened to her bracelet.
Then he pressed his lips to her forehead, and said: &#8220;I thank you for
having been so good to Eleanore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude stood as if rooted to the floor. Something seemed
to cry incessantly within her; she felt that a mortally wounded beast
was in her bosom wallowing in its blood. Long after Daniel
had gone to his room she could still be seen standing in the middle
of the floor. Wrapped in gloomy meditation, she removed the
buckle from her bracelet: she thought she saw an ugly mark where
the metal had touched her skin. She went into her room, opened
the cabinet, and hid the buckle under a pile of linen.</p>

<p>She had only one wish: she wanted to sleep. But as soon as she
would close her eyes her heart would begin to beat with doubled,
trebled rapidity. She had to get up and walk back and forth in
the room; she was struggling for breath.</p>


<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>A few days later she went out during a pouring rain storm,
and wandered about aimlessly through the streets. Every minute
she feared&mdash;and hoped&mdash;she would fall over and become unconscious
of herself and the world about her. She passed by two
churches, the doors of which were locked. It was growing dark;
she reached the apothecary shop of Herr Pflaum, and looked
in through the glass door. Herr Seelenfromm was standing at the
counter, mixing some medicine in a mortar. She went in and
asked him whether he could not give her a narcotic. He said he
could, and asked her what it should be. &#8220;One which makes you
sleep for a long, long while,&#8221; she said, and smiled at him so as
to make him inclined to fulfil her request. It was the first smile
that had adorned her grief-stricken face for many a day. Herr
Seelenfromm was just about to suggest a remedy to her. He sat
down in a vain position so that he might avail himself of the
opportunity to flirt with her a little. The apothecary, however,
came up just then, and when he heard what Gertrude wanted, he
cast a penetrating glance at her and said: &#8220;You had better go to
the doctor, my good woman, and have him make you out a prescription.
I have had some rather disagreeable experiences with cases
of this kind.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p><p>When Gertrude had finally dragged herself home, she found
Philippina sitting by the cradle of little Agnes, rocking the child
back and forth and humming a lullaby. &#8220;Where is Eleanore?&#8221;
asked Gertrude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you think she is?&#8221; said Philippina contemptuously:
&#8220;She is upstairs with your husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude heard Daniel playing the piano. She raised her head
to hear what he was playing.</p>

<p>&#8220;She told me I was to go with her to Glaishammer to get a
washwoman for you,&#8221; continued Philippina.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, what do we want with a washwoman?&#8221; said Gertrude;
&#8220;we cannot afford one. It costs a great deal of money, and every
cent of money spent means a drop of blood from Daniel&#8217;s veins.
Don&#8217;t go to Glaishammer! I would rather do the washing myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew, however, at that very moment that she had done her
last washing. There was something so mournful about the light
of the lamp. Agnes&#8217;s little face looked so pale as it peeped out
from under the covers, Philippina cowered so witlessly at the floor.
But all this was only for the moment; all this she could take with
her up into a better world.</p>

<p>She bent down over the child, and kissed it, and kissed it with
hot, burning lips. A lurk of unsoftened evil crept into Philippina&#8217;s
face. &#8220;Listen, Gertrude, listen: you are all Greek to me,&#8221;
said Philippina, &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertrude went over to Eleanore&#8217;s room, where she stood for a
while in the dark, trembling and thinking. At times she was
startled: she heard some one walking about, and she thought the
door would open. She could scarcely endure her impatience.
Suddenly she remembered the attic and how quiet it was up there;
there no one could disturb her. She decided to go up. On her
way she went into the kitchen, and took a thick cord from a
sugar-loaf.</p>

<p>As she passed by Daniel&#8217;s room, she noticed that the door was
half open. He was still playing. Two candles were standing on
the piano; Eleanore was leaning up against the side of the piano.
She had on a pale blue dress that fell down over her beautiful
body in peaceful folds.</p>

<p>Gertrude looked at the picture with wide-open eyes. There was
an inimitable urging, a reaching aloft, and a painful sinking-back in
the piece he was playing and in the way he was playing it.
Gertrude went on up without making the slightest bit of noise. It
was dark, but she found her way by feeling along with her hands.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p><h3>XIX</h3>

<p>After a half-hour had gone by, Philippina began to wonder
where Gertrude was. She looked in the living room, then in
Eleanore&#8217;s room, and then hastened up the steps and peeped
through the open door into Daniel&#8217;s room. Daniel had stopped
playing and was talking with Eleanore. Philippina turned back.
On the stairs she met Jordan just then coming in from his evening
walk. She lighted a candle, and looked in the kitchen. Gertrude
was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is raining; there is her raincoat, and here is her umbrella,
so she can&#8217;t have gone out,&#8221; thought Philippina to herself. She
sat down on the kitchen table, and stared before her.</p>

<p>She was filled with an ugly, bitter suspicion; she scented a
tragedy. In the course of another half-hour, she got up, took the
lighted candle, and started out on a second search. Something
drove her all about the house: she went out into the hall, into the
various rooms, and then back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>All of a sudden she thought of the attic. It was the expression
on Gertrude&#8217;s face the last time she kissed Agnes that made her
think of it. Was not the attic of any house, and particularly the
one in this house, the room that had the greatest attraction for her,
and that her light-fearing fancy invariably chose as the most desirable
and befitting place for her hidden actions?</p>

<p>She went up quickly and without making the least noise. Holding
the lighted candle out before her, she stared at a rafter
from which hung a human figure dressed in woman&#8217;s clothes.
She wheeled about, uttering a stifled gurgle. A sort of drunkenness
came over her; she was seized with a terrible desire to dance.
She raised one leg, and sank her teeth deep into the nails of her
right hand. In her convulsions she had the feeling that some one
was crying out to her in a strong voice: &#8220;Set it on fire! Set it
on fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>Near the chimney wall was a pile of letters and old newspapers.
She fell on her knees, and exclaimed: &#8220;Blaze! Blaze!&#8221; And
then, half with horror and half with rejoicing, she uttered a series
of irrational, incoherent sounds that were nothing more than
&#8220;Hu-hu, oi-oi, hu-hu, oi-oi!&#8221;</p>

<p>The fire from the papers flared up at once, and she ran down
the steps with a roar and a bellow that are fearful to imagine,
nerve-racking to hear.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the house was a bedlam. Daniel ran up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>steps, Eleanore close behind him. The women in the lower apartments
came running up, screaming for water. Daniel and Eleanore
turned back, and dragged a big pail full of water up the stairs.
The fire alarm was turned in, the men made their way into the
building, and with the help of many hands the flames were in time
extinguished.</p>

<p>Jordan was the first to see the lifeless Gertrude. Standing in
smoke and ashes, he sobbed and moaned, and finally fell to the
floor as if struck on the head with an axe. The men carried
Gertrude&#8217;s body out; her clothes were still smoking.</p>

<p>Philippina had vanished.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span><a name="ELEANORE" id="ELEANORE"></a>ELEANORE</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> was all over.</p>

<p>The visit of the doctor was over; and so was that of the
coroner. The investigations of the various boards, including that
of the fire department, the cross-examination, the taking of evidence,
the coming to a decision&mdash;all this was over.</p>

<p>The cause of the fire remained unexplained; a guilty party
could not be found. Philippina Schimmelweis had sworn that the
fire had already started when she reached the attic. It was therefore
assumed that the suicide had knocked over a lighted candle
in her last moments.</p>

<p>The crowd of acquaintances and close friends had disappeared;
this was over too. Hardened souls expressed their conventional
sympathy to Kapellmeister Nothafft. That a man who had carried
his head so high had suddenly been obliged to lower it in humility
awakened a feeling of satisfaction. The punished evil-doer again
gained public favour. Women from the better circles of society
expatiated at length on the question whether a relation which in
all justice would have to be designated as a criminal one while the
poor woman was living could be transformed into a legal one
after the lapse of a certain amount of time. With pimplike
generosity and match-making indulgence they decided that it
could.</p>

<p>The funeral was also over. Gertrude was buried in St. John&#8217;s
Cemetery on a stormy day.</p>

<p>The preacher had preached a sermon, the mourners had stood
with their hands stuffed in their coat pockets and their furs, for
it was cold. As the coffin was lowered into the grave, Jordan
cried out: &#8220;Farewell, Gertrude! Until we meet again, my child!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was one man who crowded right up to the edge of the
grave: it was Herr Carovius. He looked over his nose glasses at
Jordan and Daniel and Eleanore. It seemed to him that the
latter, with her pale face and her black dress, was more beautiful
than the most beautiful Madonna any Italian or Spaniard had
ever immortalised on imperishable canvas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p><p>He turned his frightened face to one side, and came very nearly
falling over the heaped-up earth by the grave.</p>

<p>With regard to Daniel&#8217;s conduct, Pflaum, the apothecary, had
this to say: &#8220;I should have expected more grief and sorrow from
him, and not so much sullenness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A hard-hearted man, an exceedingly hard-hearted man,&#8221; said
Herr Seelenfromm in his grief.</p>

<p>Daniel was severely criticised for his discourteous treatment of
the people from the City Theatre, every one of whom had come
to the funeral. When several of them shook hands with him,
he merely nodded, and blinked his eyes behind the round glasses
which he had been wearing for some time.</p>

<p>Judge Kleinlein said: &#8220;He should be very grateful for the
Christian burial, for despite the evidence that was turned in, it
was not satisfactorily proved that the woman was in her right
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore looked into the open grave. She thought: &#8220;Guilt is
being heaped upon guilt, deep, serious guilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this was over now. Daniel and Eleanore and Jordan had
come back to the house.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>They felt lonely and deserted. Jordan shut himself up in his
room. It was rare now that he took his accustomed evening walks;
his coat-sleeves and the ends of his trouser legs had become more
and more frayed. He pined away; his hair became snow white,
his walk unsteady, his eye dim. But he was never ill, and he
never complained of his fate. He never said anything at the
table; he was a quiet man.</p>

<p>Eleanore moved back up with her father, and Daniel took his
old room next to the dining room. There was all of a sudden so
much space; he was surprised that the going of a single person
could make such a vast difference.</p>

<p>Eleanore spent the whole day with little Agnes until Philippina
came and relieved her. She also did her work close to Agnes.</p>

<p>When she had finished her writing, she had to look after the
house. She could not cook, and had no desire to learn how, so she
had a woman come in three times a week who prepared the midday
meals. Twice a week she would prepare meals for two days,
and once a week she would get them ready for three days. She
was a modest woman who worked for very little money. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>food she cooked merely needed to be heated over, and in the
evening they always had sausage and sandwiches anyhow.</p>

<p>It was a practical arrangement, but no one praised Eleanore
for it.</p>

<p>At first she spent her nights in Gertrude&#8217;s room with the child;
she could not stand this, however, longer than three weeks. Either
she could not sleep, or she had such terrible dreams.</p>

<p>Then she took to carrying the child up to her room with her
and making a little bed for it on the sofa. But the child did
not sleep so well there; Eleanore noticed that, as a result of all
the excitement and hard work, she was losing strength.</p>

<p>Often in the night when she would take the child to quiet it&mdash;and
become so tired and uneasy&mdash;she would make up her mind to
have a talk with Daniel. But the next morning she would find it
impossible to bring up the subject. She felt that the voice of
Gertrude was admonishing her from beyond the grave and telling
her to be patient.</p>

<p>She felt, too, that the time was drawing near when she would
succumb to over-exertion; it made her anxious. Just then Philippina
came in to help.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>When Jason Philip heard that Philippina was going to Jordan&#8217;s
daughters every day, he told her most emphatically and repeatedly
that she had to quit it. Philippina paid not the slightest attention
to him and did as she pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you,&#8221; cried Jason Philip at the girl.</p>

<p>Philippina shrugged her shoulders and laughed impudently.</p>

<p>Jason Philip saw that a grown person was standing before him;
he was afraid of the evil look of his daughter.</p>

<p>It was long before he could make out what was taking her to his
enemies. Then he learned that wherever she chanced to be, at
home, or with acquaintances, or with strangers, she was spreading
evil reports concerning Daniel and his family. This tended to
make him a bit more indulgent: he too wanted to feast his ears on
scandal from that quarter. At times he would enter into a conversation
with Philippina, and when she told him the latest news
he was filled with fiendish delight. &#8220;The day will come when I
will get back at that music-maker, you see if I don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Theresa was still confined to her bed. During his leisure hours
Willibald had to read to her, either from the newspapers or from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>trashy novels. When she was alone she lay perfectly quiet and
stared at the ceiling.</p>

<p>The time finally came when Willibald left school. He went
to F&uuml;rth, where he was employed as an apprentice by a manufacturer.
There was no doubt in any one&#8217;s mind but that he
would become one of those loyal, temperate, industrious people
who are the pride of their parents, and who climb the social ladder
at the rate of an annual increase in salary of thirty marks.</p>

<p>The one-eyed Markus entered the paternal bookshop, where he
soon familiarised himself with the novels of the world from Dumas
and Luise M&uuml;hlbach to Ohnet and Zola, and with the popular
sciences from Darwin to Mantegazza. His brain was a book
catalogue, and his mouth an oracle of the tastes displayed at the last
fair. But in reality he not only did not like the books, he regarded
all this printed matter as a jolly fine deception practised on people
who did not know what to do with their money. Zwanziger, the
clerk, had married the widow of a cheese merchant, and was running
a shop of his own on the Regensburg Chaussee.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rotten business,&#8221; said Jason Philip at the end of each month.
&#8220;The trouble with me,&#8221; he invariably added, &#8220;is that I have been
too much of an idealist. If I had worked as hard for myself as
I have for other people, I would be a rich man to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to the caf&eacute; and discussed politics. He had developed
into a perpetual grumbler; he was pleased with nothing, neither
the government nor the opposition. To hear him talk you would
have thought that the opposing parties had been forced to narrow
their platforms down to the differences between the views of
Prince Bismarck and Jason Philip Schimmelweis. When Kaiser
Wilhelm I died, Jason Philip acted as though his appointment to
the chancellorship was imminent. And when in that same memorable
year Kaiser Friedrich succumbed to his sufferings, Jason
Philip resembled the pilot on whose isolated fearlessness the rescue
of the storm-tossed ship of state depends.</p>

<p>The born hero always finds a sphere of activity, a forum from
which to express his views. If public life has rejected him, he
goes to the caf&eacute;, where he is sure to find a congenial element.</p>

<p>One day Theresa got up from the bed where she had spent
fifteen unbroken months, and seemed all of a sudden completely
recovered. The physician said it was the strangest case that
had ever come under his observation. But Jason Philip said: &#8220;It
is the triumph of a good constitution.&#8221; With that he went to the
caf&eacute;, drank beer, made fiery political speeches, and played skat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p><p>But Theresa left her bed not as a woman forty-six years old&mdash;that
was her age&mdash;but as a woman of seventy. She had only a
few sparsely distributed grey hairs left on her square head, her
face was full of wrinkles, her eye was hard and cold. From that
time on, however, she did not seem to age. She did not quarrel
any more, attended to her affairs in a straightforward, self-assured
way, and observed her increasing impoverishment with unexpected
calm.</p>

<p>She lived on herring, potatoes, and coffee; it was the same diet
on which Philippina and Markus lived, with the one exception
that Markus, as the child nearest her heart, was allowed a piece
of sugar for his coffee. Jason Philip was also put on a diet: he
never dared open his mouth about it, either.</p>

<p>Philippina stood it for a while in silence; finally she said to
her mother: &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand this chicory brew forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll have to lap up water, you will,&#8221; replied Theresa.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Philippina. &#8220;I am going to hire out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, hire out. Who cares? It&#8217;ll be one mouth less to feed.&#8221;
&#8220;Your daughter is going to hire out,&#8221; said Theresa to her husband,
when he came home that evening.</p>

<p>Jason Philip had been playing cards that day, and had lost.
He was in a terrible humour: &#8220;She can go plumb to the Devil so
far as I am concerned.&#8221; That was his comment.</p>

<p>The next morning Philippina sneaked up to the attic, and
drew out her cash from the hole in the chimney: it amounted
to nine hundred and forty marks, mostly in gold, which she had
exchanged in the course of years for small coins. Through the
opening in the wall the June sun fell upon her face, which, never
young and bearing the stamp of extended crime, looked like that
of a witch.</p>

<p>She put the money in a woollen stocking, rolled it up in a knot,
stuffed it down her corset between her breasts, made the sign of
the cross, and repeated one of her drivelling formulas. Her
clothes, ribbons, and other possessions she had already packed in a
basket. This she carried down the stairs, and, without saying
good-bye to a soul, left the house.</p>

<p>Her brother Markus was standing with sprawled legs in the
sun before the store, whistling. He caught sight of her with his
one eye, smiled contemptuously at her, and cried: &#8220;Happy
journey!&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina turned to him, and said: &#8220;You branded lout! You&#8217;re
going to have a lousy time of it, mark what I tell you!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p><p>In this frame of mind and body she came to Daniel, and said
to him: &#8220;I want to work for you. You don&#8217;t need to pay nothing
if you ain&#8217;t got it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel had been noticing for some time that Eleanore could
not stand the exertion required of her by the extra work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you mind the baby and sleep with it?&#8221; Daniel asked.
Philippina nodded and looked down.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will take care of the child and act right toward it and
me, I shall be awfully grateful to you,&#8221; he said, breathing more
easily.</p>

<p>Thereupon Philippina threw her hands to her face, and shuddered
from head to foot. She was not exactly crying; there was
something much worse, much more despairing, in what she was
doing than in mere crying. She seemed to be convulsed by some
demoniac power; a ghastly dream seemed to have seized her in a
moment of higher consciousness. She turned around and trotted
into the room where the child was playing with a wooden horse.</p>

<p>She sat down on a foot-stool, and stared at the restless little
creature.</p>

<p>Daniel stopped, stood perfectly still, and looked at her in a
mood of solicitous reflection.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>During a rehearsal of &#8220;Traviata,&#8221; Daniel flew into a rage at
Fr&auml;ulein Varini: &#8220;Listen, pay attention to your intonation, and
keep in time. It&#8217;s enough to make a man lose his mind! What
are you squeaking up at the gallery for? You&#8217;re supposed to be
singing a song, and not whining for a little bit of cheap applause.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady stepped out to the foot-lights with heaving bosom.
Her offended dignity created something like the spread tail of a
peacock about her hips: &#8220;How dare you?&#8221; she exclaimed: &#8220;I give
you your choice: You can apologise or leave this place. Whatever
you do, you are going to become acquainted with the power I
have.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel folded his arms, let his eyes roam over the members of
the orchestra, and said: &#8220;Good-bye, gentlemen. Since it is the
director&#8217;s place to choose between me and this lady, there is no doubt
whatever but that my term of usefulness in this position
is up. And moreover, in an institution where meat is more valuable
than music, I feel that I am quite superfluous.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other singers had come running out from the wings, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>were standing crowded together on the stage looking down at the
orchestra. When Daniel laid down his baton and walked away,
every member of the orchestra rose as one man to his feet. It
was a voluntary and almost overwhelming expression of speechless
admiration. Though they had never loved this man, though they
had regarded him as an evil, alien kill-joy, who interfered with
their easy-going habits as musicians in that town, they nevertheless
respected his energy, admired the nobility of his intentions, and at
least had a vague idea of his genius.</p>

<p>Fr&auml;ulein Varini went into hysterics. The director was called
in. He promised Fr&auml;ulein Varini immediate redress, and wrote
a letter to Daniel requesting that he offer an apology.</p>

<p>Daniel replied in a brief note that he had no thought of changing
his plans as announced when he left the building. He
remarked that it was quite impossible for him to get along with
Fr&auml;ulein Varini, that either he or she would have to quit, and that
since she intended to remain he must consider his resignation as
submitted and accepted.</p>

<p>That evening, as he was sitting at the table with Eleanore, he
told her, after a long silence and in very few words, what had
happened. Her response to him was a look of astonishment; that
was all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was the only thing I could do,&#8221; said Daniel, without
looking up from his plate; &#8220;I was so heartily sick of the whole
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to live on, you and your child?&#8221; asked
Eleanore.</p>

<p>His eye became even darker and harsher: &#8220;You know, God who
makes the lilies grow in the fields ... I can&#8217;t quote that old
proverb exactly, my familiarity with the Bible is nothing to
boast of.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was all they said. The window was open; there was a
mysterious pulsing in the earth; the warm air had a disagreeable
taste, somewhat like that of sweet oil.</p>

<p>When the clock in the tower struck ten, Eleanore got up and
said good-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night!&#8221; replied Daniel, with bowed head.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>That is the way it was now every evening between the two;
for during the day they scarcely saw each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p><p>Daniel would sit perfectly still for hours at a time and brood.</p>

<p>He could not forget. He could not forget the burning, smoking
border of the dress; nor the shoes that had some street mud on
them; nor the face with the pinched upper lip, the dishevelled
hair, the nervously knitted brow.</p>

<p>Under the linen in the clothes press he had found the silver
buckle he had given her. &#8220;Why did she hide it there?&#8221; he asked
himself. The condition of her soul when she opened the press
and put the buckle in it became vivid, real; it became blended
with his own soul, a part of his own being.</p>

<p>Then he discovered the harp without the strings. He took it
to his room; and when he looked at it, he had the feeling that he
was looking at a face without flesh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I too melancholy, too heavy for you?&#8221; This was the
question that came to him from the irrevocable past. And that
other statement: &#8220;I will be your mother made young again.&#8221;
And that other one, too: &#8220;I, too, am a living creature.&#8221;</p>

<p>He recalled some old letters she had written him and which he
had carefully preserved. He read them over with the care and
caution he would have exercised in studying an agreement, the
disregard or fulfilment of which was a matter of life and death.
And there were bits of old embroidery from her girlhood which
he acquired in order to lock them up and keep them as if they
were sacred relics.</p>

<p>She stood out in his mind and his soul more vividly with each
passing hour. If he remembered how she sat and listened when
he played or discussed his works, he felt something clutching at
his throat. He recalled how she crept up to him once and
pressed her forehead against his lips: this picture was enshrouded
in the awe of an unfathomable mystery.</p>

<p>It was not a sense of guilt that bound him to his deceased wife.
Nor was it contrition or self-reproach or the longing that finds
expression in the realisation of accumulated neglect. His fancy
warded off all thought of death; in its creative defiance it invested
the dead woman with a reality she never possessed while making
her pilgrimage in bodily form over this earth.</p>

<p>It was not until now that she really took on form and shape
for Daniel. And this is the marvellous and the criminal feature
of the musician. Things and people are not his while they are
his. He lives with shadows; it is only what he has lost that is
his in living form. Dissociated from the moment, he reaches out
for the moment that is gone; he longs for yesterday and storms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>to-morrow with unassimilative impatience. What he has in his
hands is withered; what lies behind him is in flower. His thinking
is a winter between two springs: the true one that is gone, and the
one that is to come of which he dreams, but when it arrives he
fails to take it to himself. He does not see; he has seen. He
does not love; he has loved. He is not happy; he was happy.
Dead, lifeless eyes open in the grave; and the living eyes that look
into the grave, see all things, understand all things, and glorify
all things, feel as if they are being deceived by death and its
duration throughout eternity.</p>

<p>Gertrude was transformed into a melody; everything she had
done or said was a melody. Her silence was awakened, her mute
hours were made eloquent. Once he had seen her and Eleanore,
the one in a brown dress, the other in a blue, minor and major,
the two poles of his universe. Now the major arose like the night,
spread out over the lonely earth, and enveloped all things in
mourning. Grief fed on pictures that had once been daily, commonplace
occurrences, but which were illumined at present by the
brightness of visions.</p>

<p>He saw her as she lay in bed with the two braids of hair on
either side of her face, her face itself looking like a wax figure
in an old black frame. He could see her as she carried a dish into
the room, threaded a needle, put a glass to her lips to drink, or
laced up her shoe. He could see the expression in her eye when
she cautioned, besought, was amazed, or smiled. How incomparably
star-like this eye had all of a sudden become! It was
always lifted up, always bright with inner meaning, always fixed
on him. In the vision of this eye he found one evening along
toward sunset the motif of a sonata in B minor. A gesture he
remembered&mdash;it was the time Eleanore stood before the mirror
with the myrtle wreath on her head&mdash;gave the impulse to the
stirring <i>presto</i> in the first movement of a quartette. The twenty-second
Psalm, beginning &#8220;My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me?&#8221; he sketched on awakening from a dream in which
Gertrude had appeared before him in perfect repose, as pale as
death, her chin resting on her hand.</p>

<p>But it could not be said that he worked. The music he wrote
under these conditions simply gushed forth, so to speak, during
fits of fever. When the mood came over him, he would scribble
the notes on whatever lay nearest him; his haste seemed to betray
a sense of guilt. He stole from himself; tones appealed to him
as so many crimes. When the gripping melody of the twenty-second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>Psalm arose in his mind, he trembled from head to foot,
and left the house as if lashed by Furies, though it was in the
dead of night. The recurring bass figure of the <i>presto</i> sounded
to him as though it were a gruesome, awed voice stammering out
the fatal words: &#8220;Man, hold your breath, Man, hold your breath!&#8221;
And he did hold his breath, full of unresting discomfort, while
his inspiration hacked its way through the ice-locked region into
which a passionate spell that was becoming more and more a part
of his nature had driven it.</p>

<p>He saw humanity forsaking him; he watched the waves of isolation
widening and deepening around him. Since he felt that time
did not challenge him to effort of any kind, he took to despising
time. It came to the point where he regarded his creations as
something that never were intended for the world; he never spoke
about them or cherished the remotest desire that men hear of
them. The more completely he kept them in secret hiding, the
more real they appeared to him. The thought that a man could
write a piece of music and sell it for money appealed to him as
on a par with the thought of disposing for so much cash of his
mother or his sweetheart, of his child or one of his own limbs.</p>

<p>He came on this account to cherish a feeling of superb disgust
for shrewd dealers who were carried along on the wings of fashion.
He took a dislike to anything that was famous; for fame smelled
of and tasted to him like money. He shuddered at the mere
thought of the chaos that arises from opinions and judgments;
the disputes as to the merits of different schools and tendencies
made him ill; he could not stand the perambulating virtuosos of
all zones and nations, the feathers they manage to make fly, the
noise they evoke, the truths they proclaim, the lies they wade
about in and make a splash. He stood aghast at the mention of a
concert hall or a theatre; he flew into a reasoned rage when he
heard a neighbour playing a piano; he despised the false devotion
of the masses, and scorned their impotent, imbecile transports.</p>

<p>All their music smelled of and tasted to him like money.</p>

<p>He had bought the biographies of the great masters. From
them he familiarised himself with their distress and poverty; he
read of the petty attitudes and fatuous mediocrity that stood deaf
and dumb in the presence of immortal genius. But one day he
chanced to read that Mozart&#8217;s body had been buried in a pauper&#8217;s
grave. He hurled the book from him with an oath that he would
never again touch a work of that sort. The mordant smoke of
misanthropy blew into the fire of idolisation; he did not wish to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>see any one; he left the city, and found peace only after he had
reached a lonely, unfrequented place in the forest, where he felt
he was out of the reach of human feet and safe from the eyes
of men.</p>

<p>At night he would walk rapidly through the streets; his head
was always bowed. If he became tired, he betook himself to some
unknown caf&eacute; where he was sure he would not meet any of his
acquaintances. If some one whom he knew met him on the street,
he did not speak; if any one spoke to him, he was blatant and
bizarre in his replies, and hastened off as rapidly as he could, with
some caustic bit of intended wit on his loosened tongue.</p>

<p>To enter the room where Philippina and the child were required
much effort; at first he was able to do it only with pronounced
aversion. Later he came somehow to be touched by the form and
actions of the child: he would come in a few times each day for
a minute or two only, take it up in his arms, have it poke its tiny
hands into his face or even jerk at his nose glasses; he listened
with undivided interest to its baby talk. Philippina would stand
in the corner in the meanwhile, with her eyes on the floor and her
mouth closed. He became painfully aware of his obligations to
her because of her inexplicable fidelity to him, and knew that he
would never be able to reward her for her unique and faithful
assistance. He was grieved at the same time to see the child so
motherless, so utterly without the attention that ennobles. The
child&#8217;s bright eyes, its outstretched arms hurt him: he feared the
feelings slumbering even then in its breast, and was driven away
by the thought of what might happen in the future.</p>

<p>One morning in August he arose with the sun, went to the
kitchen and got his own breakfast, took his walking stick, and left
the house. He wanted to go to Eschenbach on foot.</p>

<p>He walked the entire day, making only very short stops for rest.
At noon the heat became intense; he asked a peasant, who chanced
to drive up in his hay wagon, if he might ride a little. He had
no definite end in view, no plan. Something drew him on; what
it was he did not know.</p>

<p>When he finally reached the little town it was late at night;
the moon was shining. There was not a soul on the street. The
windows of his mother&#8217;s house were all dark. He climbed up
the steps, and sat down as close to the front door as was physically
possible. He imagined he could hear his mother and the child
she had in her care breathing.</p>

<p>It seemed so strange to him that his mother knew nothing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>his presence. If she had known he was there, she would have
unlocked the door and looked at him in astonishment. And if
he had not felt like talking, he would have been obliged to lay
his head in her lap and weep. Nothing else was possible; he could
not speak. And yet the fear lest he talk, lest he be forced to tell
everything, took such firm hold on him that he decided to start
back home without letting his mother know that he had been
there and without having seen either her or the child. The peculiar
restlessness that had driven him away from his home and
impelled him to go on this unusual journey was silenced as soon
as he sat in the shadow of his mother&#8217;s little house.</p>

<p>But he was so tired that he soon fell asleep. He dreamed that
the child and the old lady were standing before him, that the
former had a great bunch of grapes in her hand and the latter
a shovel and was shovelling up the earth, her face revealing a soul
of sorrows. Eva seemed to him to be much more beautiful than
she had been a year ago; he felt drawn to the child by an uncontrollable
power and a painful love that stood in a most unusual
relation to what his mother was doing. The longer his mother
shovelled in the earth the heavier his heart became, but he could
not say anything; he felt as if a glorious song were pouring forth
from his soul, a song such as he had never heard in his life.
Enraptured by its beauty, he woke up. At first he thought he
could still hear it, but it was only the splashing of the water in the
Wolfram fountain.</p>

<p>The moon was high in the heavens. Daniel went over to the
fountain just as the night watchman came along, blew his trumpet
and sang: &#8220;Listen, all men, I wish to tell that it has struck two
from the town-hall bell.&#8221; The watchman noticed the lonely man
standing by the fountain, was startled at first, but then continued
on his rounds, repeating from time to time the words of his official
song.</p>

<p>Often as a child Daniel had read the inscription on the base
of the Wolfram figure. Now he read the words, irradiated by the
light of the moon, and they had a totally different meaning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Water gives to the trees their life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And makes with fertile vigour rife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All creatures of the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By water all our eyes are purled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It washes clean man&#8217;s very soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And makes it like an angel, whole.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p><p>Simple words, but Daniel read them in the light of a full experience,
dipped his hands in the basin, and rubbed them over his
eyes drunk with sleep; then casting one more glance at his mother&#8217;s
house, he turned in the direction of the road leading away from
the town.</p>

<p>Out in the fields it was too damp for him to lie down to rest.
Near an isolated farm house he found a hay rick, went up to it,
and lay down.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Every time Eleanore looked at Daniel her heart was filled with
the same anxiety. She did not understand him; she could not
comprehend a single one of his movements. Such joy as she had
arose from meditation on the past.</p>

<p>He did not seem to be able to recall her. One word, any word,
from him would have relieved her of her anguish; but he spoke to
her precisely as he spoke to Philippina or to Frau K&uuml;tt, the woman
who came in to do the housework.</p>

<p>It was bad enough to live with Philippina, to feel the incessant
hatred of this secretive person; to suspect that she knew things that
would not stand the light of day. But to see the child handed
over to her, treated by her as though it were her own and guarded
by her with a jealousy that made her face wrinkle with rage if
Eleanore presumed to stay with it for as much as five minutes, this
was infinitely worse.</p>

<p>It was bad enough to have to accept with filial obedience the
society of the speechless old father who spent his days and nights
in his own mysterious way, striving without peace of any kind to
reach an unknown goal. This made it hard for Eleanore. It was
spooky in the rooms upstairs, and equally spooky in the ones downstairs.
Eleanore dreaded the coming winter. At times she felt
that her own voice had an unreal sound, and that her most commonplace
remark echoed with the gloom of unhappy premonitions.</p>

<p>She sought refuge in the old pictures of her longings&mdash;southern
landscapes with groves and statues and a sea of supernatural blue.
But she was too mature to find enduring satisfaction in empty
dreams; she preferred, and felt it were better, to forget her grief
in the distractions of hard work. It was not until the pen fell
from her hand, weighed down with distress at the thought of so
many unadorned and unrelieved hours, that something drew her
back into the realm of spirits and visions. And then it was that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>she sought support, that she endeavoured to get a footing, in the
world of actual objects round about her.</p>

<p>She would take a pear, and think herself, so to speak, into the
very heart of this bit of fruit, just as if it were possible to find
protection, shelter in so small a space. Or she would take a piece
of coloured glass, hold it in her hand, and look at the world of
reality about her, hoping that the commonplace would in this
way be made to seem more beautiful. Or she looked into the
burning fire, and studied, with a smile on her face, the romantic
tongues of flames. Or she had a longing to look at old pictures: she
went to the Germanic Museum, and spent an entire morning there,
standing before a Crucifixion, a Last Supper, her eye and her heart
filled with flowing emotion.</p>

<p>Her love for flowers became stronger than ever, and she began
to study them. The most of them she picked herself; those that
grew only in gardens she bought from the florists, paying very
little for them. After she had made several purchases, they refused
to take any more money from her; they gave her just as many
flowers as she wanted. She took them home, and made bouquets
out of them.</p>

<p>One evening she was frightened by Philippina, who came rushing
up to her just as she was arranging her flowers and told her
that little Agnes had a high fever. Eleanore went out and got
the doctor, who immediately reassured her. As she returned, her
astonishment was intense and unusual. Reaching the door, her eyes
fell on the flowers: they seemed wonderfully beautiful to her; the
harmony and play of their colours was so striking that she involuntarily
looked around in the illusion that a stranger had called
during her absence, brought the flowers, and arranged them in
their artistic bouquets.</p>

<p>In the meantime poverty was haunting the house in very tangible
form. Neither the butcher nor the baker was willing any
longer to deliver goods on credit. It was quite impossible for
Eleanore to support five people with her clerical work, to say
nothing of keeping them in clothes and paying the rent. However
hard she might work, the most she could do was to get enough
money for the barest necessities. Her cares multiplied day by day.</p>

<p>She had always been an implacable foe of debts; she would not
make them. But after all, the people could not starve, and so
she had to contract debts now. Bitter humiliations were unavoidable;
she looked into the future with untempered dread. She
racked her brain trying to devise plans, deplored her weakness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>and the gaps in her training, bemoaned the neglect both she and
Daniel were suffering, and was quite disturbed to see that Philippina&#8217;s
heart was filled with joy at the thought that the destitution
of the household with its accompanying mental anguish was rapidly
increasing.</p>

<p>Twice a day the druggist sent in his bill; finally he came in
person. It was along toward evening when he rang. Philippina
treated him so impolitely that he became impudent, and made such
a noise that the people on the lower floors came out into the hall
and leaned over the railing of the stairs. Eleanore ran down and
stood before the man with folded hands. Jordan also left his
room and looked on, sighing.</p>

<p>Others came in and started trouble. Philippina came up to
Eleanore, and, with a smile on her face as if she were going to tell
of some great good fortune that had come to the family, said:
&#8220;There&#8217;s another down there, Eleanore; come down and give him
a piece of your mind, or I&#8217;m thinking he&#8217;s going to call the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>After quiet had been restored, Philippina began to rage and
rant: &#8220;Daniel&#8217;s a dunderhead. He could live like a Kaiser if he&#8217;d
mix with the right people. I know a woman who is lousy with
money, and she&#8217;s going to git a lot more; but Daniel, the poor bloke,
ain&#8217;t got a ghost of an idea as to how to work people.&#8221; She
laughed furiously; or, in order to ventilate her spiteful rage, she
picked up some object and smashed it to pieces on the floor.</p>

<p>Eleanore did not hear what she had said. Her hope was gone.
Daniel had been out of work for three months: who could explain
his strange inactivity? The rent would be due in a short while,
and then what?</p>

<p>One morning she went to Daniel&#8217;s room and said: &#8220;Daniel, we
are out of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was sitting at the table reading; he looked at her as if he
had to think for a while who she was: &#8220;Just have patience,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;you are not going to starve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am doing all that I possibly can, Daniel,&#8221; continued Eleanore;
&#8220;but tell me, please, how are you planning to keep the house
going? I see no way out. Tell me, Daniel, tell me, please, what
you are going to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A musician must be poor, Eleanore,&#8221; replied Daniel, and looked
at her with eyes that seemed to be frozen.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he has got to live, I should think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t live from husks alone, and I am not going to work
my head off for husks.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;Daniel, oh Daniel, where is your mind? And where is your
heart?&#8221; cried Eleanore in despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where I should have been long ago,&#8221; he replied, without the
shadow of a ray of hope. He got up, and turning his face away
from Eleanore, said in a half-audible voice: &#8220;Let&#8217;s have no argument,
no cogency, no urgency. Not now! Not now when I am
creeping along on the earth with such light as is left me, trying to
grope my way out of the hole. A man doesn&#8217;t give up the ghost so
quickly as all that, Eleanore. The stomach is a very elastic piece
of skin.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went into the other room, sat down at the piano, and struck
a slow-moving bass chord.</p>

<p>Eleanore turned to the wall, and buried her feverish brow in
her hands.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>It was not in Eleanore&#8217;s nature to submit to a misfortune without
first having made every possible effort to evade it.</p>

<p>She wrote for from fourteen to sixteen hours a day, with the
result that she had finished all that was asked of her long before
her time was really up.</p>

<p>Then she looked around for a better paying position; it was in
vain. Women had never been paid well, she had no recommendations,
no personal connections, nothing on which she could depend
or to which she might refer.</p>

<p>Finally it occurred to her that she might make some money out
of her flowers. She went to the florist at St. Lorenz Place, taking
with her a garland of carnations and mignonettes she had made the
day before. She told the florist she knew a great deal about
flowers and had had considerable experience in handling them.</p>

<p>The man laughed at her, and told her he could find no sale for
that kind of things, and that, even if he could, he would have to
ask so little for them that it would not pay her to make them.
Eleanore took her flowers back home; she was profoundly discouraged.
She saw herself how perishable flowers were; these withered
that same evening. Nothing could be expected from that source.</p>

<p>She had not noticed that, as she left the florist shop, a man on
the other side of the street had stopped and looked at her. He
was a haggard young individual with a pale, peevish expression on
his face, a man with a chin the unimpressiveness of which was
hidden behind a Vandyke beard.</p>

<p>He stood for a long while and looked at Eleanore as she walked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>down the street. There could be no doubt but that something in
her general bearing and her face had drawn his attention to her;
had awakened in him a feeling that was nobler than mere curiosity
or the satisfaction an idler derives from gaping.</p>

<p>The young man finally began to move; he walked rather stiffly
across the square and entered the florist&#8217;s shop. A few minutes
later the florist, a man past middle age, with the typical toper&#8217;s
nose, threw open his door and removed his cap, actions which in
addition to his fawning bow were unmistakable proof to the merchants
on either side of him that it was no ordinary sale he had
just made. The young man went his way, ambling along in shiftless
indifference to where he was or the time of day.</p>

<p>The next morning the florist&#8217;s errand boy came to Eleanore,
and told her that his chief had something very important to say
to her, and that she should come at once. Eleanore followed the
call without delay. As she entered the shop, the florist greeted
her with unusual politeness, and told her that a man who took a
special fancy to the kind of flowers she had shown him the day
before had been there and placed an order for two such bouquets,
or even three, a week at twenty marks each. He advised her
to exercise all diligence in making the flowers and said that when
such a rain of good fortune descended upon one it was wise to
let other things take care of themselves. The only condition the
florist imposed on her was absolute silence. The customer did not
wish his name to be known, nor did he wish to be seen. He
remarked casually that there was manifestly some whim or crotchet
back of the man&#8217;s action, such as is so frequently the case with
aristocratic people.</p>

<p>Who was happier than Eleanore! She never bothered herself
for a minute about the illogical and legendary element in the
offer of a man who only a day before had appeared so shrewd
and cautious. She drank in every word of the florist&#8217;s detailed
statement, and merely believed that in this city, among its inhabitants,
there was an eccentric fellow who was willing to pay
such a princely price for her flowers simply because he liked
flowers and was pleased with the way she put them up. Though
she had not been spoiled by fortune, the transformation that had
suddenly taken place in her circumstances awakened in her not
the slightest suspicion or surprise. She was too happy to be distrustful,
too grateful to become inquisitive. Her thoughts were
on Daniel, who, she felt, was saved. The whole way home she
smiled to herself as if lost in dreams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p><p>Evening after evening she sat with the flowers she had gathered
in the forenoon from the forests, the meadows, and the gardens
out by the city fortress, where an old gardener went with
her and picked out the choicest specimens for her. He had a
crippled son who fell in love with Eleanore and always stood
in the door and smiled at her when she came. He promised
he would get her flowers from the green house during the
winter.</p>

<p>The butcher was paid, the baker was paid; the druggist was
paid, and so was the rent. Philippina shook her head, and swore
there was something wrong. She was convinced that it would
all come out some day, even if you had to scratch the dung hill
to get at the secret. She told the people about a ghost that carried
on every night up in the attic; and once when the moon was
shining she came running into the room and swore that a bony
finger had rapped on the window.</p>

<p>Eleanore bound roses and gilliflowers, tulips and pansies, mosses,
ferns, and what-not into beautiful tapestried pictures, or wound
them into wreaths and garlands. She gave herself up to this novel
occupation with the sacrificial love of a woman of her type; and
at times she became dizzy from so much fragrance. But this mattered
not. She arranged her flowers; and then she would lean out
of the window, and sing gently into the night.</p>

<p>Daniel was ignorant of what she was doing; he had not troubled
himself about the distressing poverty of past weeks; he did not
concern himself now with their abundance; where it came from
he never asked.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Eberhard von Auffenberg had returned to the city shortly after
the death of Gertrude Nothafft. The last large sum he had
received from Herr Carovius, now nearly a year ago, he had almost
used up. He found Herr Carovius quite changed in his attitude
toward him. Herr Carovius declared that he was bankrupt, that he
could not get any more money for him. Instead of complaining
or boasting, or flattering his princely friend, or trying to incite
him to activity of some kind, as he had been accustomed to do, he
wrapped himself in a silence that could not be regarded as a
favourable omen.</p>

<p>Eberhard had no desire to beg. Herr Carovius&#8217;s personality was
so disagreeable to him that he refused to investigate the cause of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>his novel behaviour. He let his thoughts take their own course;
and they drifted into other channels.</p>

<p>The gossip afloat concerning Eleanore had naturally reached his
ears. Herr Carovius had seen to it that there was no lack of
insinuations, either written or oral. But Eberhard had ignored
them. Offensive insults that had dared attach themselves to
Eleanore seemed to him as incredible as litter from the street on
the radiant moon.</p>

<p>One day he had to call on Herr Carovius because of a note that
had been protested. They discussed the affair in a dry, business-like
way, and then, all of a sudden, Herr Carovius fixed his piercing
eyes on the Baron, walked around the table time after time,
dressed in his sleeping gown, and told, without the omission of a
single detail, of the lamentable death of Daniel Nothafft&#8217;s young
wife.</p>

<p>He became highly excited; why, it would be hard to say. &#8220;Let
us hope that the Kapellmeisterette will come to his senses now,&#8221;
he cried in a falsetto voice. &#8220;He is already on the point of starvation;
ah, believe me, he is nearly done for. It will be necessary
to take up a collection for the unrecognised genius. He has already
put one of his women in the grave, the other is still kicking.
By the way, how do you like her, the angel? Are you not a bit
sorry for the neat little halo that now hangs like a piece of castoff
clothing on the bedpost of an adulteress? Of course, geniuses are
allowed to do as they please. O Eleanore, bloody lie that you are,
you hypocritical soft, sneaking, slimy lie&mdash;Eleanore!&#8221;</p>

<p>With that Eberhard stepped up very calmly to the unleashed
demon in pajamas, seized him by the throat, and held him with such
a fierce and unrelenting grip that Herr Carovius sank to his knees,
while his face became as blue as a boiled carp. After this he was
remarkably quiet; he crept away. At times he tittered like a
simpleton; at times a venomous glance shot forth from under his
eyelids. But that was all.</p>

<p>Eberhard poured some water in a basin, dipped his hands in it,
dried them, and went away.</p>

<p>The picture of the whining man with the puffed and swollen
eyes and the blue face was indelibly stamped on Eberhard&#8217;s memory.
He had felt a greedy, voluptuous desire to commit murder. He
felt he was not merely punishing and passing final judgment on
his own tormentor and persecutor, but on the hidden enemy of
humanity, the arch-criminal of the age, the destroyer of all noble
seed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p><p>And yet the exalted outburst of Herr Carovius had precisely the
effect that Eberhard had least expected. His confidence in Eleanore&#8217;s
innocence had been shaken. There may have been in Herr
Carovius&#8217;s voice, despite the slanderous wrath with which his cowardly
tongue was coated, something that sounded truer than the
wretch himself suspected. Eberhard saw just then, for the first
time in his life, the adored figure of the girl as a human being
like all other human beings; and as if through a distant vision he
experienced in his heart what had taken place.</p>

<p>His illusions were destroyed.</p>

<p>In his soul he had gone through the trials of renunciation long
ago. His passionate wishes of former times had gone through
a process of weakening from loss of blood. He had learned to
bow to the inevitable; he had made a special effort to acquire this
bit of earthly wisdom. When he surveyed the life he had lived
in the past five years, it resembled, despite its flux and the incessant
change from city to city and country to country, a sojourn
in a room with closed doors and drawn shades.</p>

<p>When he had returned to the city, which he loved simply
because Eleanore lived in it, he had had no intention of reminding
Eleanore of the expiration of the time mutually agreed upon.
He felt that it would be a banal display of poor taste to appear
before her once again as an awkward, jilted suitor, and try to reconnect
the thread where it had been so ruthlessly broken five
years ago. He had intended not to disturb her or worry her in
any way. But to go to her and speak with her, that had been the
one bright ray of hope in all these empty years.</p>

<p>After the scene with Herr Carovius he decided quite firmly to
keep away from Eleanore.</p>

<p>His ready cash had shrunk to a few hundred marks. He discharged
his servants, disposed of some of his jewelry, and rented
one of those little houses that are stuck on the rocks up by the
castle like so many wasp nests. The house he took had been
occupied before him by the Pfragners, and with its three rooms
was not much larger than a fair-sized cage in a menagerie. But
he had taken it into his head to live there, and that was all there
was to it. He bought some old furniture, and adorned the
slanting walls of the dilapidated barracks with such pictures as he
had.</p>

<p>One evening there was a knock at the green door of the cottage.
Eberhard opened, and saw Herr Carovius standing before
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p><p>Herr Carovius entered the Baron&#8217;s doll house, looked around in
astonishment, and, pale as a sheet, said: &#8220;So help me God, it seems
to me you are trying to play the r&ocirc;le of a hermit. This won&#8217;t
do; this is no place for a Baron; I will not stand for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eberhard reached for the book he had been reading, a volume
of Carl du Prel, and read on without replying to Herr Carovius
or even taking notice of the fact that he was present.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius tripped from one foot to the other. &#8220;Perhaps
the Baron will be so good as to take a look at his account,&#8221; he
said in a beseeching tone. &#8220;I am in a tight place. My capital is
gone, and my debts in the shape of interest have been swelling
like the Pegnitz in the spring of the year. Would you like to
know what I have been living on for the last three months? I
have been living on turnips, potato peelings, and brick cheese; that
has been my daily diet; and I have submitted to it for the sake of
my Baron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not a bit interested in what you have been eating,&#8221; said
the Baron arrogantly, and kept on reading.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius continued with an imbecile sulk: &#8220;When you left
me recently because of that little quarrel we had about the Goose
Man, it never occurred to me that you were going to take the
matter so seriously. Lovers like to be teased, I thought. He&#8217;ll come
back, I thought, he&#8217;ll come back just as sure as laughter follows
tickling. Well, I was mistaken. I thought you were of a more
gentle disposition, and that you would be more indulgent with an
old friend. Yes, we make mistakes sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eberhard remained silent.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius sighed, and sat down timidly on the narrow edge
of the sofa that stood next to the whitewashed wall. He sat there
for almost an hour in perfect silence. Eberhard appreciated
neither the ridiculous nor the fantastic element in the conduct of
his guest. He read on.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, Herr Carovius sprang to his feet,
took his wallet from his pocket, drew out a thousand-mark note,
and laid it, together with a blank receipt, across the page Eberhard
was reading. Before the Baron could recover from his amazement
he had already disappeared, closing the door behind him.
The sound of his footsteps on the street could be heard in the
room; but he was gone.</p>

<p>What rare living creatures there are, O World, and what rare
dead ones, too! This is the thought that passed through Eberhard&#8217;s
mind.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p><h3>IX</h3>

<p>That two men as radically different by nature as Eberhard and
Daniel chanced to meet and be drawn together at the very period
of their lives when both had voluntarily renounced human society
was due to one of those decrees of Providence that contain in
them either a law of crystallisation or the attraction of polar
forces, however much they may seem to be matters of pure chance.</p>

<p>Their coming together took place on the day after Daniel had
gone to Eschenbach. At the break of day, Daniel had decided
to return by way of Schwabach, both for the sake of variety
and because this was the shorter route. The sun was hotter
than on the day before; and when it had reached the height of
its ability to dry up the land and scorch a human being, Daniel lay
down in the forests. Late in the afternoon, just as he was approaching
Schwabach, great black clouds began to gather in the
West; a fearful storm was evidently to be expected. Heavy streaks
of lightning flashed across the sky; and although Daniel tried to
hasten his steps, the storm overtook him. Before he could reach the
shelter of a house, he was wet to the skin from head to foot.</p>

<p>The rain came down in torrents. He waited a long while, and
then had to start out in it again, arriving finally at the station
shivering with cold. As he went to buy his ticket he noticed a
lean, haggard, unusual looking individual standing at the ticket
window. It is quite probable that, vexed by his uncomfortable
condition, Daniel treated him none too courteously; he pushed up
against him, whereupon the man turned around, and Daniel recognised
the young Baron, Eberhard von Auffenberg. Eberhard in
turn recognised Daniel. It is unlikely that there was at that time
another face in the world which could belong so completely to
just one person as that of Daniel.</p>

<p>The Baron had been attracted to Schwabach by his affection for
a certain person there, an affection he had preserved from the
days of his childhood. There lived in Schwabach at the time a
woman who had been his nurse. Her undivided and resigned love
for him was touching. She was as proud of him as she might have
been had she been able to say that in him she had been responsible
for the childhood training of the noblest specimen of manhood
known to human history. And he was fond of her; the stories
she told him he could still recall, and he did recall them frequently
and with pleasure. She had married the foreman of a tin mill,
and had sons and daughters of her own. Eberhard had been planning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>for years to visit her. This visit had now been paid. But
Eberhard could not say that he had derived extraordinary pleasure
from it: it had taken an inner figure from his soul. And, on the
other hand, whether the nurse felt, on seeing the tall, lank, stiff,
and ill-humoured foster son, that enraptured charm she so much
liked to conjure up before her imagination, is a question that had
better remain unanswered.</p>

<p>When Eberhard became aware of the condition in which Daniel
then found himself, his feelings of chivalry were moved. With
the dauntless courage of which he was capable, he subdued the
apathy he had cherished toward Daniel ever since he first came to
know him, and to which actual detestation and disquieting jealousy
had been added a few weeks ago. &#8220;You have been out in the
rain,&#8221; said Eberhard courteously, but with a reserve that was rigid
if not quite forbidding or impenetrable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I look like it, don&#8217;t I?&#8221; said Daniel with a scowl.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will catch cold if you are not careful. May I offer you
my top coat?&#8221; continued Eberhard more courteously. He felt as
if he could see the figure of Eleanore rising up behind Daniel, that
she was quite surrounded by flowers, and that she was smiling at
him in joy and gratitude. He bit his lips and blushed.</p>

<p>Daniel shook his head: &#8220;I am accustomed to all kinds of weather.
Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, at least wrap this around your neck; the water is
running down your back.&#8221; Thereupon Eberhard reached him a
white silk kerchief he drew from the pocket of his coat. Daniel
make a wry face, but took the kerchief, threw it about his neck,
and tied it in a knot under his chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he admitted, and drew his head down between
his shoulders: &#8220;It all reminds me of a good warm bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eberhard stared at the locomotive of the in-coming train.
&#8220;Plebeian,&#8221; he thought, with inner contempt.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he joined this same plebeian in the third-class carriage,
though he had bought a ticket for first class. Was it the
white silk kerchief that so suddenly attracted him to the plebeian?
What else could it have been? For during the entire journey
they sat opposite each other in absolute silence. It was a remarkable
pair: the one in a shabby, wet suit with a hat that looked
partly as though it belonged to a cheap sign painter, and partly as
though it were the sole head gear of a gypsy bard, and with a
big pair of spectacles from which the eyes flashed green and unsteady;
the other looking as though he had just stepped out of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>bandbox, not a particle of dust on his clothing, in patent leather
slippers, English straw hat, and with an American cigarette in his
mouth.</p>

<p>Next to them sat a peasant woman with a chicken basket on her
lap, a red-headed girl who held the hind part of pig on her knees,
and a workman whose face was bandaged.</p>

<p>At times they looked at each other. If they chanced to catch
each other&#8217;s eye, the Baron would at once look down, and Daniel,
bored as he was, would gaze out of the window at the rain. But
there must have been something unusually communicative and
mutually intelligent in the few glances with which they involuntarily
honoured each other during the journey; for when the train
pulled into the station, they left together, and walked along the
street quite peacefully, side by side, just as if it were to be taken
as a matter of fact that they would remain in each other&#8217;s company.</p>

<p>Man is a gregarious animal; given the right conditions, one man
will seek out the company of another. Neither defiance nor reserve
is of the slightest avail; there is something that conquers the
strongest man when he finds another who will yield. Then it is
that what was formerly regarded as contentment with loneliness is
unmasked and shown to be nothing more than ordinary self-deception.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume you wish to go home and change your clothes,&#8221; said
Eberhard, standing on the street corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am already dry,&#8221; said Daniel, &#8220;and I really have no desire to
go home. Over there on Sch&uuml;tt Island is a little inn called
the Peter Vischer. I like it because it is frequented only by old
people who talk about old times, and because it is situated on a
bridge, so that you have the feeling you are in a ship floating around
on the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eberhard went along. From eight o&#8217;clock till midnight they sat
there opposite each other. Their conversation was limited to such
remarks as, &#8220;It is really quite comfortable here.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;It seems to
have stopped raining.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Yes, it has stopped.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;That old white-bearded
man over by the stove who is doing so much talking is a
watchmaker from Unschlitt Place.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;So? He looks pretty
husky.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;He is said to have fought in the battle of W&ouml;rth.&#8221;&mdash;And
so their remarks ran.</p>

<p>When they separated, Eberhard knew that Daniel would again
be at the Peter Vischer on Wednesday of the following week, and
Daniel knew that he would find the Baron there.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p><h3>X</h3>

<p>Philippina was on her knees by the hearth, cleaning out the
ashes; Eleanore was sitting by the kitchen table, adding up the
week&#8217;s expenses in a narrow note-book.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought-a git married, Eleanore,&#8221; said Philippina, as she
blew on a hot coal, &#8220;&#8217;deed you ought; it&#8217;s the right time for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, leave me alone,&#8221; said Eleanore angrily.</p>

<p>Philippina crouched still lower on the hearth: &#8220;I mean well by
you, I do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You&#8217;re simply killing yourself here. With
your white skin and sugary eyes&mdash;uhm, uhm! You bet if I had
&#8217;em like yours I&#8217;d git one. Men are all as dumb as shoats outside
of a sty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep quiet,&#8221; said Eleanore, and went on counting: &#8220;Seven from
fifteen leaves eight....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An angel has made your bed,&#8221; interrupted Philippina with a
giggle. &#8220;I know a fellow,&#8221; she went on, her face becoming rather
sour, &#8220;he&#8217;s just the right one. Money? whew! He&#8217;s stuck on
you too, believe me! If I wuz to go to him and say, Eleanore
Jordan is willing, I believe the old codger would give me a bag of
gold. Cross my heart, Eleanore, and he&#8217;s a fine man too. He can
play the piano just as good as Daniel, if not better. When he
plays you can see the sparks fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore got up, and closed the book. &#8220;Do you want me to
give you a present for finding me a man, Philippina?&#8221; she asked,
with a sympathetic smile. &#8220;And you are trying to sound me? Go
on, you fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come wind and blow my fire hot, so that my soup be not
forgot,&#8221; whispered Philippina with a gloomy face.</p>

<p>Eleanore left the kitchen and went upstairs. Her heart was
full of longing; it was in truth almost bursting with longing.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>It was at the beginning of October that Daniel for the first time
visited Eberhard in his doll house up by the castle.</p>

<p>They had met each other in the Peter Vischer on the evening
agreed upon, but there was a special party there that evening, a
sort of a clam-bake; the place was crowded; the noise was disagreeable,
so that they left much earlier than they had intended.</p>

<p>They walked along in silence until they reached the Town Hall,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>when Eberhard said: &#8220;Won&#8217;t you come up and sit awhile with me?&#8221;
Daniel nodded.</p>

<p>Eberhard lighted the six candles of a chandelier in his diminutive
room. Seeing that Daniel was surprised, he said: &#8220;There is
nothing I hate worse than gas or oil. That is light; gas and oil
merely give off illuminated stench.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a while there was complete silence in the room; Daniel had
stretched out on the sofa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Illuminated stench,&#8221; he repeated with a smile of satisfaction.
&#8220;That is not bad; it is the new age in which we are living. I
believe they call it <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i>. The day when things flourish is
gone; everything has to be manufactured now. Men have become
Americans, gruesomely sobered by the intoxication of doing
a big business; women have lost their nicety of instinct; the cities
have become colossal steam engines; everybody, young and old, is
on his belly adoring the so-called wonders of science, just as if
it really meant anything to humanity that a loafer in Paris can
sip his morning coffee and crunch his rolls while reading that the
Pope spent a restful night, or that a gun has been invented which
will send a bullet through fourteen people one after another,
whereas the best record up to the present had been only seven to
a shot. Who can create anything, who can draw anything from his
soul under such conditions? It is madness, it is immoral discipline.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know; I think a man can draw something from
within his soul,&#8221; said the Baron, in whose face a bored, peeved
expression gave way to one of suspense. &#8220;It is possible, for example,
to conjure the invisible spirit into visibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel, who had not yet suspected that the Baron was, in a way,
speaking from another country and in a strange tongue, continued:
&#8220;The whole supply of interest and enthusiasm at the disposal of
the nation has been used up. The venerable creations of days
gone by still have nominal value; that is, they are still gaped at
and praised, but creative, reproductive, and moulding power they
no longer have. Otherwise hocus-pocus alone prospers, and he
who does forgive it is not forgiven. But life is short; I feel it
every day; and if you do not attend to the plant, it soon withers
and dies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not only hocus-pocus,&#8221; replied Eberhard, who was now
completely transformed, though he did not grasp the painful
indignation of the musician. &#8220;You see, I have associated but very
little with men. My refuge has been the realm of departed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>invisible spirits who take on visible form only when a believing
soul makes an unaffected appeal to them. It was my task to de-sensualise
and de-materialise myself; then the spirits took on shape
and form.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel straightened up, and saw how pale the Baron had become.
It seemed to him that they were both quite close together,
and at the same time poles removed from each other. He could
not refrain however from taking up the thread of his thought.
&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; he exclaimed with the same short, jerky laugh that
accompanied the beginning of the conversation, &#8220;my little spirits
also demand faith, credulity, and whine and cry for form and
shape. You have expressed yourself in an admirable way, Baron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And have you given up in final resignation with regard to
your spirits?&#8221; asked Eberhard, in a serious tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Resignation? To what? Of what? Do you imagine that
is necessary in my case? I am the counterpart of Cronos. My
children devour me; they devour my living body. I conjure up
spirits and endow them with flesh and blood, and in return for
what I do they convert me into a shadow. They are rebellious
fellows, I tell you, quite without mercy. I am supposed to arouse
a citizenry on their behalf that is petrified with indifference.
The very thing, or things, that offend and disgust me, I am supposed
to take up and carry about on an unencumbered shoulder.
I am supposed to be their prostitute and offer them my body at a
price. I am supposed to be their retail grocer and haggle in their
behalf. There is something inspiring about a struggle, and when
the enemy is worthy of one&#8217;s steel there is a distinct pleasure in
entering the fray. But my little spirits want to be pampered and
have a lot of attention paid them. The hate, consequently, that
is being dammed up within me is possibly nothing but rage at my
fruitless wooing. No, mine is not an honest hate, because I long
to get at every ragged beggar who will have nothing to do with
my spirits, because my entire life consists in pleading for an audience
with people who do not care to listen, and scraping together
pennies of love from people who cannot love, because two or three
are not enough for me, because I must have thousands and am
nothing if I don&#8217;t have thousands, and pine away in anguish and
distress if I cannot imagine that the whole world is keeping step
with my pace and keeping in time with the swing of my baton.
I can despise Mushroom Mike who lies down by his wife at night
drunk as a fool, and to whom the name of Beethoven is an empty
sound; Jason Philip Schimmelweis makes me laugh when he looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
me in the face and says, I don&#8217;t give a damn for all your art.
And yet there is humanity in such people, and so long as this is
true I must have them; I must convince them, even if my heart is
torn from my breast in the attempt. Would you call this life?
This digging-up of corpses from the graves, and breathing the
breath of life into them so that they may dance? And doing it
with the consciousness that this moment is the only one? I am;
I exist; here is the table, there are the wax candles, and over there
sits a man; and when I have stopped talking everything is different,
everything is as if a year had passed by, and everything
is irrevocable. Show me a way to humanity, to men, and then
I will believe in God.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baron&#8217;s head swam; his brain felt close; it seemed to be
sultry, stuffy in his skull. He could not help but think of certain
exciting meetings where the people had sat in the dark in trembling
expectancy and then suddenly heard a voice from beyond the
tomb at the sound of which the marrow froze in their bones. He
hardly dared look at the place where Daniel was sitting. The
words of the musician caused him infinite pain: there lay in them
a greediness, a shamelessness, and a gruesomeness that filled him
with terror.</p>

<p>He could almost have asked: And Eleanore? And Eleanore?</p>

<p>But however much he felt repelled, owing to his training, association,
and general views of life, there was nevertheless something
about the whole situation before which he bowed. He could not
have said precisely what it was, but it seemed to be a compromise
between fear and convulsion.</p>

<p>As he was pondering over it all, he heard a rattling at the window.
He looked up, and saw the face of Herr Carovius pressed
so tightly against the pane that his nose was as flat as a pancake,
while his glasses looked like two opalescent grease spots on the
water.</p>

<p>Daniel also looked up; he too saw the face of Herr Carovius,
then distorted with wrath and filled with threats. He looked at
the Baron in amazement; the latter got up and said: &#8220;You will have
to pardon the annoyance; I forgot to draw the blinds.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he went to the window, and pulled down the dark
shade over the face of Herr Carovius.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>That same night, just as Daniel was crossing the hall of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>apartment, he detected a strong scent of flowers. He had smelt
them before, but they had never seemed to be so fragrant as at
present. Because of the season of the year, the sensation was all
the more pronounced and unusual.</p>

<p>He sniffed around for a while, and then saw that the door to
Eleanore&#8217;s room was open: her light was shining out on the stairs.</p>

<p>When Daniel was not at home of an evening, Eleanore always
kept her door open so that she could hear when he came in.
Daniel was unaware of this; he had never seen the light on any
previous night.</p>

<p>He thought for a moment, then locked the door, and went up
the stairs. But Eleanore must have heard his approaching footsteps;
for she stepped hastily out into the vestibule, and said with evident
embarrassment: &#8220;Please stay downstairs, Daniel; Father is asleep.
If you wish I will come down to the living room.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not wait for his answer, but went into her room, got
the table lamp, and followed Daniel to the living room. Daniel
closed the window, and shook as if he were cold; for it was a cool
night, and there was no fire in the stove.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this I smell?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Have you so many flowers
up in your room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have some flowers,&#8221; replied Eleanore, and blushed.</p>

<p>He looked at her rather sharply, but was disinclined to make
any further inquiry, or he was not interested in knowing what this
all meant. He walked around the room with his hands in his
pockets.</p>

<p>Eleanore had sat down on a chair; she never once took her
eyes off Daniel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Daniel,&#8221; she said suddenly, and the violin tone of her
voice lifted him from his mute and heavy meditations, &#8220;I know
now what Father is doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is the old man doing?&#8221; asked Daniel distractedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is working at a doll, Daniel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At a doll? Are you trying to poke fun at me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore, whose cheeks had turned pale, began to tell her story:
&#8220;Yesterday afternoon, Father took advantage of the beautiful
weather, and went on a walk for the first time in a long while.
During his absence, I went to his room to straighten it up a little. I
noticed that the door to the large cabinet was not closed as usual,
but was standing ajar. He probably forgot to lock it. I did not
suspect anything, and knew that there was no harm in what I
was going to do, so I opened the door, and what did I see? A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>big doll, about the size of a four-year-old child, a wax figure with
big eyes and long, yellow hair. But there were no clothes on it:
the lower part of the back and the front from the neck to the
legs had been removed. Inside, there where a person&#8217;s heart and
entrails are, was a network of wheels and screws and little tubes and
wires, all made of real metal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is strange, really strange. Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is making something,&#8221; continued Eleanore, &#8220;that much is
clear. But if I could tell you how I felt when I saw the thing!
I never felt so sad in my life. I have shown him so little love,
just as Fate has been so unlovely to him. And everything&mdash;the
air and the light and the people and how one feels towards the
people and how they feel towards you, all seemed to me to be so
hopelessly without love that I could not help it: I just sat down
before that doll and cried. The poor man! The poor old
man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange, really strange,&#8221; repeated Daniel.</p>

<p>After a while, as if conscious of his guilt, he took a seat by the
table. Eleanore however got up, went to the window, and leaned
her forehead against the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here to me, Eleanore,&#8221; said Daniel in a changed tone
of voice.</p>

<p>She came. He took her hand and looked into her face. &#8220;How
in the world have you been keeping the house going all this
time?&#8221; he asked, viewing the situation in the light of his guilty
conscience.</p>

<p>Eleanore let her eyes fall to the floor. &#8220;I have done my writing,
and I have had considerable success with the flowers. I have
even been able to save a little money. Don&#8217;t look at me like that,
Daniel. It was nothing wonderful I did; you have no reason to
feel especially grateful to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew her down on his knees, and threw his arms around her
shoulders. &#8220;You probably think I have forgotten you,&#8221; he said
sorrowfully, and looked up, &#8220;that I have forgotten my Eleanore.
Forget my Eleanore? My spirit sister? No, no, dear heart, you
have known for a long while that we have begun our common
pilgrimage&mdash;for life, for death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore lay in his arms; her face was perfectly white; her
body was rigid; her eyes were closed.</p>

<p>Daniel kissed her eyes: &#8220;You must hold me, keep me, even when
it seems that I have left you,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>Then he carried her in his arms through the door into his room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;I have so longed, I have been so full of longing,&#8221; she said,
pressing her lips to his neck.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Before one could realise it, winter had come, and the Place
with the Church was covered with snow.</p>

<p>Eleanore had gone skating; when she returned she sat down in
the living room to wait for Daniel. There she sat with her fur
cap on her head, holding her skates in her hand by the cord: she
was tired&mdash;and she was thinking.</p>

<p>Daniel entered the room and greeted her; she looked up, and
said with a gentle voice: &#8220;I am with child, Daniel; I found it out
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fell on his knees, and kissed the tips of her fingers.
Eleanore drew a deep breath; a smile of dream-like cheerfulness
spread over her face.</p>

<p>The following day Daniel went to the Town Hall, and made
arrangements to have the banns posted.</p>

<p>Hardly had Philippina heard that Daniel and Eleanore were
to get married in February when she disappeared; she did not
leave a trace of her whereabouts behind her. Little Agnes cried in
vain for her &#8220;Pina.&#8221; Six days after Philippina had left, she came
back just as mysteriously as she had gone away. She was desperately
gloomy; her hair was towsled, her clothes were wrinkled,
there were no soles on her shoes; she was as speechless as a
clod, and remained so for weeks.</p>

<p>No one knew, nor has any one ever found out, what she did
during those six days or where she had been.</p>

<p>Eleanore insisted on a church wedding; this caused Daniel a
great deal of worry; it made him run many a vexatious errand.
But he consented to do as Eleanore had asked; for he did not wish
to deprive her of any pleasure she might imagine such a ceremony
would give her. Eleanore made her own white dress and her veil.
Gisela Degen, a younger sister of Martha R&uuml;bsam, and Elsa
Schneider, the daughter of the rector of the Church of St. &AElig;gydius,
were to be her bridesmaids. Marian Nothafft and Eva
were also to come over from Eschenbach; Eleanore had already
sent them the money for the tickets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help me with my sewing, Philippina,&#8221; said Eleanore one
evening, and handed her silent house companion the veil, the
border of which had to be made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p><p>Philippina took her seat opposite Eleanore, and began to sew;
she was silent. In the meanwhile, little Agnes, tottering about on
the floor, fell and began to cry in a most pitiable fashion. Eleanore
hastened over and picked the child up. Just then she heard
a sound as if cloth were being torn. She looked around, and saw
that the veil had an ugly rip in it: &#8220;You wicked thing! What
do you mean, Philippina?&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do it; it tore itself,&#8221; growled Philippina, taking every
precaution to see that Eleanore might not catch her cowardly eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;You just leave that alone! Keep your hands off of it! You
will sew evil thoughts into my veil,&#8221; replied Eleanore, filled with
forebodings.</p>

<p>Philippina got up. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s torn anyway, the veil,&#8221; she said
in a defiant tone; &#8220;if harm is to come it will come; you can&#8217;t
keep it off by sending me away.&#8221; Philippina left the room.</p>

<p>The injury to the veil was not as great as Eleanore had feared.
It was a relatively easy matter to cut off the torn piece entirely,
and still use the remainder.</p>

<p>But from that hour Eleanore was filled with sadness: her face
might be compared to a beautiful landscape on which the first fog
of autumn has settled. It is probable that the tearing of her veil
had nothing to do with her depression: there was not a shimmer
of superstition in her. Perhaps it was merely happiness and fulfilment:
it may be that she felt the end had come, that happiness
and fulfilment leave nothing more to be desired, that life from
then on would be nothing but a hum-drum existence which does
not give but only takes.</p>

<p>Perhaps her mind was darkened and weighed down with grief
because of the life within her body; for that which is to come
sends out its rays of melancholy just as well as that which has come
and gone. What was there to hinder a pure soul from having an
inner premonition of the fate that was in store for it? Why
should this soul not learn in its dreams of the inevitable that was
not so far ahead?</p>

<p>It was impossible to notice any change in Eleanore; her eyes
were bright; she seemed peaceful. She would often sit before the
mask of Zingarella; she hung it with fresh flowers every day: to
her the mask was a mysterious picture of all that her own being,
her own life, embraced.</p>

<p>Marian Nothafft came to the wedding alone. Just as in the
case of Daniel&#8217;s wedding to Gertrude, she had left the child with
a neighbour. She told Daniel and Eleanore that she could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>think of taking the child out on such a journey in the dead of
winter. She mentioned Eva&#8217;s name or talked about her only in a
half audible, subdued voice, a tender smile playing gently about
her lips.</p>

<p>Among those present at the wedding in the &AElig;gydius Church
were Judge and Frau R&uuml;bsam, Councillor Bock, Impresario D&ouml;rmaul,
Philippina Schimmelweis, Marian Nothafft, and Inspector
Jordan. On the very last bench sat Herr Carovius; underneath
one of the pillars, unseen by most of the people in the church,
stood Baron Eberhard von Auffenberg.</p>

<p>Philippina walked along in an ugly, crouched, cowering fashion
by the side of Jordan; had it not been that she was constantly
chewing her finger nails, one would have thought she was asleep.</p>

<p>As the bridal couple was marching up to the altar, the sun broke
out, and shone through the windows of the old church. The
effect was touching; for just then Eleanore raised her head,
stroked her veil back from her forehead, and caught the full light
of the sun in her radiant face.</p>

<p>Old Jordan had laid his forehead on the prayer-desk; his back
was quivering.</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>Late at night and in senseless excitement&mdash;for he was thinking
of a bridal bed that filled him with the most intense pangs of
jealousy&mdash;Herr Carovius sat in his room playing Chopin&#8217;s <i>&eacute;tude</i>
of the revolution. He would begin it again and again; he struck
the keys with ever-increasing violence; the time in which he
played the <i>&eacute;tude</i> became wilder and wilder; the swing of his gestures
became more and more eloquent; and his face became more
and more threatening.</p>

<p>He was squaring accounts with the woman he had been unable
to bring before his Neronic tribunal in bodily form; and all the
pent-up hatred in his heart for the musician Nothafft he was
emptying into the music of another man. The envy of the man
doomed to limit his display of talent to the appreciation of what
another had created laid violent hands on the creator; the impotence
of the taster was infuriated at the cook. It was as if a flunked
and floored comedian had gone out into the woods to declaim his
part with nothing but the echo of his own voice to answer back.</p>

<p>His hatred of things in general, of the customs of human
society, of order and prosperity, of state and family, of love and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>marriage, of man and woman, had burst out into lurid flames. It
was rare that a man had so cut, slashed, and vilified himself as
did this depatriated citizen while playing the piano. He converted
music into an orgy, a debauch, a debasing crime.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough!&#8221; he bellowed, as he closed with an ear-splitting discord.
He shut the piano with a vituperative bang, and threw himself
into a rickety leather chair.</p>

<p>What his inner eye saw mocks at language and defies human
speech. He was in that house over there; it lay in his power to
murder his rival; he could abuse the woman who had been denied
him by the wily tricks of circumstances; he chastised her; he
dragged her from her bed of pleasure by the hair. He feasted
on her sense of shame and on the angry twitchings of the musician,
tied, bound, and gagged. He spared them no word of calumniation.
The whole city stood before his court, and listened to the
sentence he passed. Everybody stood in awe of him.</p>

<p>Thus it is that the citizen of the moral stature of Herr Carovius
satisfies his thirst for revenge. Thus does the Nero of our time
punish the crimes mankind commits against him in that it creates
pleasures and enjoyments of which he is not in a position to
partake.</p>

<p>But because he felt more abandoned to-day than ever, and more
fearful in his abandonment, and because he felt so keenly the
injustice done him by the man on whom he had hung for years
with dog-like fidelity, and who avoided him to-day as one avoids
an old dog that is no longer fit for anything, he decided in the
depths of his embittered soul to avenge himself, and to do it by a
means that would be quite different from playing the piano in
accordance with the rules of his own perverted fancy.</p>

<p>With this decision in mind he sought sleep&mdash;at last.</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>Jordan was now living all alone in the two attic rooms. He
had asked of his own will that he be permitted to take over the
clerical work Eleanore had been doing, and her employers had
agreed to this arrangement. He was consequently enabled to pay
the rent and a little on his board.</p>

<p>Daniel and Eleanore slept in the corner room in the front. Daniel
moved his piano into the living room, and did all his work there.
Philippina and Agnes remained in the room next to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Eleanore still made the bouquets, and still received the fancy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>price for them from the unknown purchaser. But she did not
attend to her flowers in Daniel&#8217;s presence, or even near him; she
did this in the old room up next to the roof.</p>

<p>Her father would sit by her, and look at her thoughtfully. She
had the feeling that he knew of everything that had taken place
between her and Gertrude and Daniel, but, out of infinite delicacy
and modesty, and also in grief and pain, had never said a word
about it. For previous to her marriage with Daniel, he had never
been with her; he had never sat and looked at her so attentively;
he had always passed by her in great haste, and had always shown
an inclination to be alone.</p>

<p>She had the feeling that he knew a great deal in general about
men and things, but rarely said anything because of his superior
sense of gentleness and compassion.</p>

<p>Daniel lived about as he did before the wedding. He would
sit at the table until late at night and write. It often happened
that Eleanore would find him sitting there with his pen in his hand,
sound asleep, when she got up early in the morning. She always
smiled when this took place, and wakened him by kissing him on the
forehead.</p>

<p>He wrote the notes direct from his memory, from his head, just
as other people write letters. He no longer needed an instrument
to try what he had composed or to give him an inspiration for a
new theme.</p>

<p>Once he showed Eleanore eighteen variations of the same melody.
He had spent the whole night making changes in a single composition.
Eleanore&#8217;s heart was heavy: she came very nearly asking,
&#8220;For whom, Daniel? For what? The trunk up in the attic?&#8221;</p>

<p>She slowly began to perceive that it is not brooding reason that
climbs and conquers the steps of perfection, but moral will. Like
a flash of lightning she recognised one day the demoniacal element
in this impulse, an impulse she had been accustomed to ascribe to
his everlasting fidgeting, fumbling, and grumbling. She shuddered
at the hitherto unsuspected distress of the man, and took pity on
him: he was burying himself in darkness in order to give the world
more light.</p>

<p>The world? What did it know about the creations of her Daniel!
The big trunk was full of <i>opus</i> upon <i>opus</i>, and not a soul troubled
itself about all these musical treasures resting in a single coffin.</p>

<p>There was something wrong here, she thought. There must be a
lost or broken wheel in the clock-work of time; there was some
disease among men; some poison, some evil, some heinous oversight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p><p>She could think of nothing else. One day she decided to visit
old Herold. At first he acted as though he would chew her to
pieces, but afterwards he became more civil, at least civil enough to
listen to her. Her features were remarkably brilliant and agile as
she spoke. He expressed himself as follows later on: &#8220;If some one
had promised me eternal blessedness on condition that I forget the
picture of this pregnant woman, as she stood before me and argued
the case of Daniel Nothafft <i>vs.</i> The Public, I would have been
obliged to forego the offer, for I could never have fulfilled my
part of the agreement. Forget her? Who would demand the
impossible?&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Herold begged her to send him one of Daniel&#8217;s latest compositions,
if she could. She said she would, and the next morning
she took from the trunk the quartette in B minor for strings, and
carried it over to the professor. He laid the score before him, and
began to read. Eleanore took a seat, and patiently studied the many
little painted pictures that hung on the wall.</p>

<p>The hour was up. The white-haired man turned the last leaf
and struck his clenched fist on the paper, while around his leonine
mouth there was a play partly of wrath and partly of awe. He said:
&#8220;The case will be placed on the calendar, you worthiest of all
Eleanores, but I am no longer the herald.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked back and forth, wrung his hands, and cried: &#8220;What
structure! What colourful tones! What a wealth of melody,
rhythm, and originality! What discipline, sweetness, power! What
a splendid fellow he is! And to think that a man like that lives
right here among us, and plagues and tortures himself! A disgrace
and a shame it is! Come, my dear woman, we will go to him at
once. I want to press him to my bosom....&#8221;</p>

<p>But Eleanore, whose face burned with the feeling of good fortune,
interrupted him, and said: &#8220;If you do that, you will spoil
everything. It will be much better to tell me what to do. He
will become more and more obstinate and bitter, if some ray of
light does not soon fall on what he has thus far created.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man thought for a while: &#8220;You leave the score with me;
I&#8217;ll see what I can do with it; I have an idea,&#8221; he replied, after
a short time had elapsed.</p>

<p>Eleanore went back home full of hope.</p>

<p>The quartette was sent to Berlin, and placed in the hands of
a man of influence and discrimination. Some professional musicians
soon became acquainted with it and its merits. Professor Herold
received a number of enthusiastic letters, and answered them with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>characteristic and becoming shrewdness. A cycle of sagas was
soon afloat in Berlin concerning the habits and personality of the
unknown master. It was said that he was an anchorite who lived
in the Franconian forests and preached renunciation of all earthly
pleasures.</p>

<p>In Leipzig the quartette was played before an invited audience.
The applause was quite different from what it ordinarily was in the
case of a public that is surfeited with musical novelties.</p>

<p>Thereby Daniel finally learned what had been done. One day
he received a letter from the man who had arranged the concert,
a certain Herr L&ouml;wenberg. The letter closed as follows: &#8220;A
community of admirers is anxious to come into possession of your
compositions. They send you their greetings at present with
cordial gratitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel could scarcely believe his own eyes; it was like magic.
Without saying a word he handed the letter to Eleanore. She
read it, and looked at him quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am guilty,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I stole the quartette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so? Do you realise, Eleanore, what you have done
to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore&#8217;s face coloured with surprise and fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to know; probably in the future you will lose
interest in such womanish wiles.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked back and forth, and then stepped up very close to
her: &#8220;You probably think I am an idiotic simpleton, a dullard.
You seem to feel that I am one of those rustic imbeciles, who has
had his fingers frozen once, and spends his days thereafter sitting
behind the stove, grunting and shaking every time anybody says
weather to him. Well, you are wrong. There was a period when
I felt more or less like that, but that time is no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>He started to walk back and forth again; again he stopped:
&#8220;It is not because I think they are too good, nor is it because
I am too inert or cowardly, that I keep my compositions under
lock and key. I would have to have wheels in my head if I did
not have sense enough to know that the effect of a piece is just
as much a part of it as heat is a part of fire. Those people who
claim that they can quite dispense with recognition and success
are liars and that only. What I have created is no longer my
property: it longs to reach the world; it is a part of the world;
and I must give it to the world, provided, do you hear? <i>provided</i>
it is a living thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, Daniel,&#8221; said Eleanore, somewhat relieved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;That is where the trouble lies,&#8221; he continued, as though he
had never been interrupted, &#8220;it all depends on whether the piece
has life, reality, the essence of true being in it. What is the
use of feeding people with unripe or half-baked stuff? They
have far too much of that already. There are too many who try
and even can, but what they create lacks the evidence that high
heaven insisted on its being created: there is no divine <i>must</i> about
it. My imperfect creations would merely serve as so many stumbling
blocks to my perfect ones. If a man has once been seduced
by the public and its applause, so that he is satisfied with what
is only half perfect, his ear grows deaf, his soul blind before he
knows it, and he is the devil&#8217;s prey forever. It is an easy matter
to make a false step, but there is no such thing as turning back
with corrective pace. It cannot be done; for however numerous
the possibilities may be, the actual deed is a one-time affair. And
however fructifying encouragement from without may be, its effects
are in the end murderous if it is allowed to drown out conscience.
What I have created in all these years is good enough so far as it
goes, but it is merely the preparatory drill to the really great work
that is hovering before my mind. It is possible that I flatter
myself; it may be that I am being cajoled by fraud and led on by
visions; but it is in me, I feel certain of it, and it must come to
light. Then we shall see what sort of creature it is. Then all
my previous works will have ceased to exist; then I will bestir
myself in a public way; I will come out and be the man that I
really am. You can depend on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel had never talked to Eleanore in this way before. As she
looked at him, overcome almost by the passion of his words, and
saw him standing there so utterly fearless, so unyielding and
unpitying, her breast heaved with a sigh, and she said: &#8220;God
grant that you succeed, and that you live to enjoy the fruits of
your ambition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all a matter of fate, Eleanore,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>He demanded the quartette; it was sent back to him.</p>

<p>From then on Eleanore suppressed even the slightest sense of discontent
that arose in her heart. She felt that he needed cruelty
and harshness for his small life in order to preserve love and
patience for the great life.</p>

<p>Yes, she prayed to Heaven that she might leave him harsh and
cruel.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p><h3>XVI</h3>

<p>&#8220;Eleanore is my wife,&#8221; said Daniel every now and then; he
would even stop in the middle of the street in order to enjoy to
the full, and preserve if possible, the blessed realisation of this fact.</p>

<p>He always knew it. Yet when he was with Eleanore he frequently
forgot her presence. There were days when he would
pass by her as though she were some chance acquaintance.</p>

<p>Then there were other days when his happiness made him sceptical;
he would say: &#8220;Is it then really happiness? Am I happy?
If so, why is it that I do not feel my happiness more fervently,
terribly?&#8221;</p>

<p>He would frequently study her form, her hands, her walk, and
wish that he had new eyes, so that he might see her anew. He
went away merely in order that he might see her better. In the
night he would take a candle, and go up to her bed: a gentle
anguish seemed to disappear from her features, his own pulse beat
more rapidly. This was caused by the flame-blue of her eyes.</p>

<p>There is a point where the most demure and chaste woman
differs in no wise from a prostitute. This is the source of infinite
grief to the man who loves. No woman suspects or can understand
it.</p>

<p>It was one day while he was brooding and musing and quarrelling
without definite reason, in the arms of his beloved, that the
profound, melancholy motif in the first movement of his symphony
in D minor came to him. This symphony gradually grew into
the great vision of his life, and, many years later, one of his
women admirers gave it the modifying title of Promethean. The
first time the theme sounded in his ears he roared like a wild
beast, but with joy. It seemed to him that music was really born
at that moment.</p>

<p>He pressed Eleanore so tightly to his bosom that she could not
breathe, and murmured between his teeth: &#8220;There is no choice
left: we have got to remain lifeless and irresponsive to each other&#8217;s
presence or wound one another with love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The mask, the mask,&#8221; whispered Eleanore anxiously, and
pointed over to the corner from which the mask of Zingarella,
with the dim light falling on it, shone forth like the weirdly beautiful
face of a spectre.</p>

<p>Philippina stood before the door, and listened to what they
were saying. She had caught a rat, killed it, and laid the cadaver
in the door. The next morning, as Eleanore was going into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>kitchen, she saw the dead rat, screamed, and went back to her
room trembling with fright.</p>

<p>Daniel stroked her hair, and said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Eleanore. Rats
belong to married life just as truly as salty soup, broken dishes,
and holes in the stockings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now listen, Daniel, is that meant as a reproach?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my dear, it is not a reproach; it is merely a picture of
the world. You have the soul of a princess; you know nothing
about rats. Look at those black, staring, pearly eyes: they remind
me of Jason Philip Schimmelweis and Alfons Diruf and Alexander
D&ouml;rmaul; they remind me of the reserved table, the <i>Kaffeeklatsch</i>,
smelly feet, evenings at the club, and everything else that is
unappetising, vulgar, and base. Don&#8217;t look at me in such astonishment,
Eleanore, I have just had an ugly dream; that is all. I
dreamt that a miserable-looking wretch came up to me and kept
asking me what your name is, and I couldn&#8217;t tell him. Just think
of it: I could not recall your name. It was terribly annoying.
Farewell, farewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had put on his hat and left. He ran out in the direction
of Feucht, and stayed the entire day in the open fields without
taking a single bit of nourishment except a piece of black bread
and a glass of milk. But when he returned in the evening his
pockets were bulging with notes he had jotted down while out
there by himself.</p>

<p>He came back by way of the Castle, and knocked at Eberhard&#8217;s
door. Since there was no one at home, he sauntered around for
a while along the old rampart, and then returned about nine
o&#8217;clock. But the windows were still dark.</p>

<p>He had not seen Eberhard for two months. He could still
recall the Baron&#8217;s depression and worry the last time he had talked
with him&mdash;it was toward the end of March: he had spoken very
little at that time and had gazed into space with remarkably lifeless
eyes. He gave the impression of a man who is on the point of
doing something quite out of the ordinary if not distinctly terrible.</p>

<p>Daniel did not become aware of this until now; the Baron&#8217;s
troubles, whatever they were, had not occurred to him during the
past weeks; he was sorry for having neglected him so.</p>


<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>When he came home Eleanore was suffering from premature
birth pains. Philippina greeted him with the words: &#8220;There is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>going to be an increase in the family, Daniel.&#8221; Whereat she
burst out in a coarse laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up, you beast,&#8221; cried Daniel: &#8220;How long has she been
suffering? Why didn&#8217;t you get the nurse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I leave the child here alone? Don&#8217;t growl so!&#8221; replied
Philippina angrily. She went out for the nurse. In a half an
hour she came back with her: it was Frau Hadebusch.</p>

<p>Daniel had a disagreeable feeling. He wanted to raise some
questions and make some objections, but Frau Hadebusch&#8217;s nimble
tongue anticipated him. She grinned, curtsied, rolled her eyes,
and went through the entire category of acquired mannerisms on
the part of a woman of her type, and then unloaded her life
history: Her duly wedded husband had said farewell to this vale
of tears three years ago, and since then she had been supporting,
as well as she could, herself and her poor Henry, the idiot, by
hiring out as a midwife. She seemed already to have come to
an understanding with Eleanore, for when she entered the
room, Eleanore greeted her as though she were an old acquaintance.</p>

<p>While Daniel was alone with Eleanore for a few minutes, he
asked her in an indignant tone: &#8220;How did you ever come to get
that vicious woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanore replied in a gentle and unsuspecting tone: &#8220;She came
to me one day, and asked to be called in when the child was born.
She said she was awfully fond of you, and that you had once lived
in her house. Well, I thought, what difference does it make who
comes, so I engaged her, and there she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was only with the greatest difficulty that she finished saying
what was on her mind. Her face, white as a sheet, was
pinched with an expression of terrific pain. She reached for
Daniel&#8217;s hand, and held it so tightly that he became rigid with
anxiety.</p>

<p>When she began to groan, Daniel turned away and pressed his
fists together. Frau Hadebusch came in with a tub of hot water:
&#8220;This is no place for men,&#8221; she exclaimed with a kindly twisting of
her face, took Daniel by the shoulder, and pushed him out the
door.</p>

<p>Little Agnes was standing in the hall. &#8220;Father,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put that child to bed!&#8221; said Daniel, turning to Philippina.</p>

<p>Jordan came out of the kitchen. He held an earthen bowl of
soup in his hand. It had been saved for him, and all he had to
do was to hold it over the fire and heat it up. He went up to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>Daniel, and said, as his chin quivered: &#8220;May God protect her,
and be merciful to her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quit that kind of talk, Father,&#8221; said Daniel impatiently.
&#8220;God rules with reservations that make me insane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you say good-night to little Agnes?&#8221; asked Philippina
in a rude, rough tone from the other room.</p>

<p>He went in; the child looked at him timidly. The more it
grew, the greater his own shyness became in its presence. And
the constant association of Eleanore with the child had always
been a source of worry to him. There was one thing of which
he was mortally certain: he could not see Eleanore in bodily form
and precisely as she was, when Agnes, with her Gertrude eyes and
her arched Eleanore mouth, was present in the room with Eleanore.
He felt that Eleanore had been transformed into the sister of
Agnes, that she was still only a sister. And this he felt was something
fatal.</p>

<p>Both of the sisters looked at him out of Agnes&#8217;s big childish
eyes; in her they were both melted and moulded into a single
being. A presageful horror crept over him. Sisters! The word
had a solemn sound in his ears; it seemed full of mysterious meaning;
it took on mythical greatness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleep, baby, sleep, outside are two sheep, a black one and a
white one&nbsp;...&#8221; sang Philippina in her imbecile way. It was
astonishing the amount of malevolence there was in her sing-song.</p>

<p>Daniel could not stand it in the house; he went out on the street,
and wandered around until midnight. If he made up his mind to
go home, the thought occurred to him at once that Frau Hadebusch
would prevent him from going into Eleanore&#8217;s room. He felt like
lying down on the pavement and waiting until some one came and
told him how Eleanore was getting along.</p>


<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>It struck one just as he came home. The maid from the first
floor and the maid from the second were standing on the stairs.
They had not been able to sleep; they had heard the cries of the
young woman from their rooms, had come out, joined each other,
listened, trembled, and whispered.</p>

<p>Daniel heard one of them say: &#8220;The Kapellmeister should send
for the doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other sobbed and replied: &#8220;Yes, but a doctor can&#8217;t work
miracles.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;Lord, Lord,&#8221; they cried, as a nerve-racking cry from Eleanore
rang through the bleak house.</p>

<p>Daniel sprang up the steps. &#8220;Run for Dr. M&uuml;ller just as fast
as your feet can carry you,&#8221; said Daniel to Philippina, who was
then standing in the kitchen in her bare feet with her hair hanging
down her back. Daniel was breathing heavily; Philippina was
making some tea. Daniel then hastened into Eleanore&#8217;s room; Frau
Hadebusch tried to keep him out, but he pushed her to one side,
gritted his teeth, and threw himself on the floor by Eleanore&#8217;s bed.</p>

<p>She raised her head; she was a pale as death; the perspiration
was pouring down over her face. &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t be here, Daniel,
you shouldn&#8217;t see me,&#8221; she said with much effort, but her tone
was so commanding and final that Daniel got up and slowly left
the room. He was seized with a strange, violent anger. He went
out into the kitchen and drank a glass of water, and then hurled
the glass on the floor: it broke into a hundred pieces.</p>

<p>Frau Hadebusch had followed him; she looked very much discouraged.
When he noticed the frame of mind she was in, he
became dizzy; he had to sit down in order to keep from falling.
&#8220;Ah, the doctor will come,&#8221; he said in a brusque tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, it makes you sick at the stomach to see how women
suffer to-day,&#8221; said the old lady in her shrillest, one-tooth voice;
it was quite plain that she was pleased to know that the doctor was
coming. The present case had got her into serious trouble, and she
wanted to get out of it. &#8220;The devil to these women who are so
delicately built,&#8221; she had said about an hour ago to the grinning
Philippina.</p>

<p>Philippina came back with the announcement that Dr. M&uuml;ller
was on a vacation: &#8220;Well, is he the only physician in the city, you
dumb ox?&#8221; howled Daniel, &#8220;go get Dr. Dingolfinger; he lives
here close by: right over there by the Peller House. But wait a
minute! You stay here; I&#8217;ll go get him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Dingolfinger was a Jewish physician, a rather old man, and
Daniel had to ring and ring to get him out of his bed. But
finally he heard the bell, got up, and followed Daniel across the
square. Daniel had left the lantern burning at the front gate,
and with it he lighted the doctor through the court and up the
stairs.</p>

<p>Then he sat down on the bench in the kitchen; how long he
sat there he did not know; he bent his body forward and buried
his head in his hands. The screams became worse and worse:
they were no longer the cries of Eleanore but of some unsouled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>dehumanised being. Daniel heard them all; he could think of
nothing, he could feel nothing but that voice. At times the terrible
cry ran through his heart: Sisters! Sisters!</p>

<p>Frau Hadebusch came out several times to get hot water. The
yellow tooth in her lower jaw stuck out like a cracked, lecherous
remainder and reminder of her past life. Once Dr. Dingolfinger
himself came out, rummaged around in his leather case, which he
had left in the hall, looked at Daniel, and said: &#8220;It is going to
come out all right; it will all be over in a short while.&#8221; At
that Philippina poked at the fire, and put on fresh coals. She
looked at Daniel out of one corner of her eye, and went on her
way. From time to time old Jordan rapped on the wall to have
Philippina come up and tell him how things were going.</p>

<p>It must have been about four o&#8217;clock in the morning; the gloomy,
grey stones in the walls of the court yard were already being
covered with rosy tints from the East. There was a cry so fearful,
so like that of a voice from the wilds of the heart, that Daniel
sprang to his feet and stood trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>Then it became quiet, mysteriously, uncannily quiet.</p>


<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>He sat down again; after a while his eyes closed, and he fell
asleep.</p>

<p>He must have slept about half an hour when he was wakened
by the sound of footsteps.</p>

<p>Standing around him were the physician, Frau Hadebusch, and
Philippina. The doctor said something at which Daniel shook
his head. It sounded like: &#8220;Unfortunately I cannot keep the sad
news from you.&#8221; Daniel did not understand him; he drew his
lips apart, and thought: &#8220;The idea of dreaming such disordered
stuff!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother and child are both dead,&#8221; said the old physician, with
tears in his eyes. &#8220;Both dead. It was a boy. Science was powerless;
nature was hostile and the stronger of the two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So delicately built,&#8221; murmured Frau Hadebusch, in a tone of
disapproval, &#8220;as delicate as the stem of a plant.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Daniel at last realised that he was not dreaming, that
these were in bitter truth Philippina&#8217;s glistening eyes and Frau
Hadebusch&#8217;s goatish tooth and Dr. Dingolfinger&#8217;s silvery beard,
and that these were actual words that were being spoken to him,
he fell over and became unconscious.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p><h3>XX</h3>

<p>Pain, grief, despair, such terms do not describe his condition.</p>

<p>He knew nothing about himself; he had no thoughts; he lay
on the sofa in the living room day and night, ate nothing, said
nothing, and never moved.</p>

<p>When they carried the empty coffin into the death chamber,
he burrowed his face into the corner of the sofa. Old Jordan
tottered through the room to take a last look at his dead daughter.
&#8220;He has sinned,&#8221; Jordan sobbed, &#8220;sinned against God in Heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the hall some people were whispering. Martha R&uuml;bsam and
her husband had come in. Martha was crying. Her slender
figure with her pale face appeared in the doorway; she looked
around for Daniel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to see your Eleanore before the coffin is
closed?&#8221; asked Philippina in a hollow voice.</p>

<p>He never moved; the twitchings of his face were terrible to
behold.</p>

<p>Beside him on the table was some cold food; also some bread
and apples.</p>

<p>They carried the coffin out. He felt that where his heart once
was there was now a dark, empty space. The church bell rang,
the rain splashed against the window panes.</p>

<p>During the second night he felt his soul suddenly become
incoherent, lax. This was followed by a brief flaring up within
him, whereupon his eyes were filled with hot, burning tears.
He resigned himself to the situation without audible display of
grief; he felt all of a sudden that he had now for the first time
in his life really sensed the beauty of the pure triad in the
major key.</p>

<p>Another day passed by. He could hear old Jordan walking about
in the room above him, ceaselessly and with heavy tread. He felt
cold; Philippina came in; he asked her to get him a blanket.
Philippina was most eager to be of service to him. The door
bell rang; Philippina opened.</p>

<p>Before her stood a lady and a gentleman. There was something
so refined about them that Philippina did not dare raise any
objections when they quietly came in and went straight to the
living room: the door had not been closed, and they could see
Daniel lying on the sofa.</p>

<p>Daniel looked at them quite indifferently. Gradually he began
to collect his thoughts, to compose himself, to come to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p><p>His guests were Eberhard von Auffenberg and his cousin, Sylvia
von Erfft. They were betrothed.</p>

<p>Taken up as he had latterly been with the marked changes and
transformations in his life, Eberhard had not heard of the death
of Eleanore until a few hours ago.</p>

<p>It was a rare visit. None of the three said a word. Daniel
lay wrapped in his blanket; he never moved. Finally, when his
friends were about to leave, Sylvia got up, and turning to Daniel,
said: &#8220;I did not know Eleanore, but I feel as if I had lost one of
my own dear friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eberhard tossed his chin in the air, turned pale, and was as
silent as the tomb.</p>

<p>They repeated their visit on the following day, and then on
the next day, and so on. The presence of the two people came
in time to have a beneficent effect on Daniel.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">A few</span> days later, Herr Carovius carried out the scheme he
had decided upon at the time his heart became so embittered at
Eleanore&#8217;s marriage.</p>

<p>It was the end of March. Herr Carovius had learned that the
old Baron had just returned from Berlin. He went around to
his house, and sent in his card. The butler came out, and told
him that the Baron could receive no one, that he should state his
business in writing.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius, however, wanted to see his debtor face to face:
this was the heart of his dream. When he came back a second
time and was again told that he could not see the Baron, he began
to storm and bluster, and insisted that they should at least let
him talk with the Baroness.</p>

<p>The Baroness was just then taking her music lesson. The fifteen-year-old
Dorothea D&ouml;derlein, who gave promise of developing
into a remarkable virtuoso on the violin, was playing some sonatas
with the Baroness.</p>

<p>Andreas D&ouml;derlein had recognised her talents when she was a
mere child. Since her tenth year, she had been obliged to practise
six hours every day. She had had a great number of different
teachers, all of whom had been brought to the point of despair
by her intractability. In the presence of her father, however,
she was meek: to him she bowed.</p>

<p>Andreas D&ouml;derlein had recommended his daughter to the
Baroness in words replete with objective recognition. The
Baroness declared her willingness to play with Dorothea. Andreas
D&ouml;derlein had said to her: &#8220;Now you have a chance to rise in the
world through powerful influence; don&#8217;t neglect it! The Baroness
loves the emotional; be emotional. At times she will demand the
demoniac; be obedient. Like all rich people, she is pampering
some grief <i>de luxe</i>; don&#8217;t disturb her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea was docile.</p>

<p>They were playing Beethoven&#8217;s spring sonatas, when the altercation
began out in the vestibule. The maid came in and whispered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>something to her mistress. The Baroness arose and went to
the door. Dorothea laid her violin in her lap, and looked around
in affected astonishment, as though she were coming out of a
dream.</p>

<p>At a sign from the Baroness the old servant gave Herr Carovius
a free path. He went in: his face was red; he made a quite
ridiculous bow. His eyes drank in the velvet porti&egrave;res, the cut
glass mirrors, the crystal vases, and the bronze statuettes. In the
meantime, and without fail, he had placed his right hand against
his hip, giving the fine effect of right akimbo, and set one foot
very elegantly a trifle more to the fore than the other: he looked
like a provincial dancing-master.</p>

<p>He complained of the presumptuousness of the servants, and
assured the Baroness that she was in complete enjoyment of his
deference. He spoke of his good intentions and the pressure of
circumstances. When the impatient bearing of his sole but distinguished
auditor at last obliged him to come to the real purpose
of his visit, the Baroness twitched; for from his flood of words
there emerged, as she heard them, nothing but the name of her son.</p>

<p>With panting sounds she came up to Herr Carovius, and took
him by the coat-sleeve. Her dim, black eyes became as round as
little bullets; the supplicating expression in them was so much
balm to the soul of her visitor.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius was enchanted; he was having the time of a
scurvy life; he became impudent; he wanted to take vengeance on
the mother against the son. He saw that the Baroness did not
correspond to the picture he had made of a creature who belonged
to the aristocracy. In his imagination she had lived as a domineering,
imperious, inaccessible phenomenon: and now there stood
before him an old, obese, worried woman. On this account he gave
his voice a shriller tone, his face a more scurrilous expression than
was his wont. Then he launched forth on a graphic narration of
the unhappy plight in which he now found himself as a result
of his association with Baron von Eberhard, Jr.</p>

<p>He claimed that it was nothing but his own good nature that
had got him into this trouble. And yet, what was he to do?
The Baron would have starved to death, or become morally depraved,
if he had not come to his spiritual and pecuniary rescue,
for the young man was sadly wanting in the powers of moral
resistance. And what had he gained by all this altruism? Ingratitude,
bitter ingratitude!</p>

<p>&#8220;He plundered me; he took my last cent, and then acted as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>it were my damned duty to go through fire for his baronical
excellency,&#8221; screamed Herr Carovius. &#8220;Before I came to know
him I was a well-to-do man; I could enjoy myself; I could reap
the higher pleasures of human existence. To-day I am ruined.
My money is wasted, my house is burdened with mortgages, my
peace of mind has gone plumb to the Devil. Two hundred and
seventy-six thousand marks is what the young man owes me and
my business friends. Yes&mdash;two hundred and seventy-six thousand
marks, including interest and interest on the interest, all neatly
noted down and signed up by the duly authorised parties. Am I
to let him slam the door in my face because of his indebtedness
to me? I think you will see yourself that that cannot be expected
of me. He at least owes me a little respect for what I have
done for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baroness had listened to all this with folded hands and
unfixed eyes. But the close of the story was too much for her:
she threw herself on a great divan, overcome&mdash;for the time being&mdash;with
worry and maternal weakness. A grin strayed across Herr
Carovius&#8217;s face. He twirled his Calabrian headpiece in his hands,
and let his leery eyes wander about the walls. Then it was that
he caught sight of Dorothea, whom he had thus far failed to see
in his intoxication of wrath and rapture.</p>

<p>When Herr Carovius entered, Dorothea, out of discretion rather
than with serious intent, had made herself as small as possible in
the most remote corner of the room. Trembling with curious
excitement, she had wished to evade the eye of her uncle Carovius,
for in very truth she was ashamed of him.</p>

<p>She regarded him as a sort of comic freak, who, though he had
enough to live on, could not be said to be in the best of circumstances.
When he rolled the sum the Auffenberg family owed
him from his tongue, she was filled with astonishment and delight,
and from then on she took a totally different view of him.</p>

<p>During the last few years Herr Carovius had seen very little of
Dorothea. Whenever he had met her, she had passed by him in
great haste. He knew that she was taking violin lessons: he had
often heard her screechy fiddling on the stairs and out in the hall.</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes on her, and exclaimed: &#8220;Well I&#8217;m a son-of-a-gun
if there isn&#8217;t D&ouml;derlein&#8217;s daughter! How did you get here?
Aha, you are going about and showing the people what you can
do! I should think you and your creator would have had enough
of music by this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baroness, recalling that the young girl was present, raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>her eyes and looked at Dorothea reproachfully. For the first time
in her life she felt that the resources she had managed to extract
from a life of neglect were about exhausted; for the first time
in her life she felt a shudder at the thought of her musical
stupefactions.</p>

<p>She asked Herr Carovius to have patience, adding that he would
hear from her in a few days&mdash;as soon as she had talked the matter
over with her husband. She nipped in the bud a zealous reply
he was about to make, and nodded a momentary farewell to Dorothea,
who put her violin in the case, took the case in her hand,
curtsied, and followed her uncle out of the room.</p>

<p>She remained at his side; they went along the street together.
Herr Carovius turned to her from time to time, and made some
rancorous remark. She smiled modestly.</p>

<p>With that began the strange relation that existed between the
two from then on.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>It had looked for some time as though the Baron von Auffenberg
had retired from the political stage. In circles in which he had
formerly been held in unqualified esteem he was now regarded as
a fallen hero.</p>

<p>His friends traced the cause of his failure to the incessant friction
from which the party had suffered; to the widespread change
that was taking place in the public mind; to the ever-increasing
pressure from above and the never-ceasing fermentation from
below; to the feverish restlessness that had come over the body
politic, changing its form, its ideals, and its convictions; and to the
more scrupulous and sometimes reactionary stand that was being
taken on all matters of national culture.</p>

<p>But this could not explain the hard trace of repulsion and
aversion which the Baron&#8217;s countenance had never before revealed
when in the presence of men; it threw no light, or at most an
inadequate light, on the stony glare, gloomy impatience, and reticence
which he practised now even in those circles and under
those circumstances in which he had formerly been noted for his
diverting talents as a conversationalist and companion.</p>

<p>In his heart of hearts he had, as a matter of fact, always despised
his political constituents, their speeches, their action, their enthusiasm,
and their indignation. But he had never kicked over the
traces, for during the course of a rather eventful life he had made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>the discovery that contempt and an icy disposition are invaluable
adjuncts to any one who wishes to control men.</p>

<p>Even though he had fought at the beginning of his career with
all the eloquence and buoyancy at his command for freedom and
tolerance, it remained a fact that he regarded liberalism as nothing
more than a newspaper term, a means of keeping men busy who
were too indolent to think for themselves, and a source of obstructive
annoyance to the openly hated but secretly admired Bismarck.</p>

<p>He had wielded a power in full consciousness of the lie he was
acting, and had done it solely by gestures, calculations, and political
adroitness. This will do for a while, but in time it eats into the
marrow of one&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>In his eyes nothing was of value except the law, unwritten to
be sure, but of immemorial duration, that subjects the little to the
big, the weak to the strong, the immature to the experienced, the
poor to the rich. In accordance with this law humanity for him
was divided into two camps: those who submitted to the law, and
the undesirable citizens who rebelled against the law.</p>

<p>And of these undesirable citizens his son Eberhard was the most
undesirable.</p>

<p>With this stinging, painful thorn in his flesh, oppressed by the
feeling of loneliness in the very midst of a noisy, fraudulent
activity, and filled with an ever-increasing detestation of the superfluity
and consequent effeminacy of his daily existence, he had
created out of the figure of his son a picture of evil incarnate.</p>

<p>He visualised him in dissipation and depravity of every kind
and degree; he saw him sinking lower and lower, a traitor to his
family name; as if in a dream that appeases the sense of obscene
horror, he saw him in league with the abandoned and proscribed,
associating with thieves, street bandits, high-flying swindlers, counterfeiters,
anarchists, prostitutes, and literati. He saw him in dirty
dives, a fugitive from justice wandering along the highway, drunk
in a gambling den, a beggar at a fair, and a prisoner at the bar.</p>

<p>His determination to wait until the degenerate representative of
the human family had been stigmatised by all the world he finally
abandoned. His impatience to find peace, to throw off the mask,
to rid himself completely of all entanglements, dissimulation, and
the life of luxury to which he had been accustomed became so
great, that he looked forward to the day that would eventually
mark his release as the day of a new birth.</p>

<p>But why did he hesitate? Was there still an element of doubt
in his breast? Was there still slumbering, deep down in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>regions of his heart that were inaccessible to bitterness and revenge,
another picture of his son? Why did he hesitate from week to
week, from month to month?</p>

<p>In the meantime he had donated great fortunes to poor houses,
hospitals, foundations, and similar causes. He wanted to give away
other millions, at least so much that his heirs would receive only
the gleanings of what had once been a field of riches. Emilia
was to be given the income from the breweries and the country
estates.</p>

<p>To this extent he had firmly made up his mind. Now that his
wife had told him of the actual condition in which Eberhard
found himself, he felt justified in going ahead and carrying out
his pre-determined plans. The proofs of dishonourable conduct
on the part of his son could now be brought forward. The debts
he had contracted, either through flippancy or downright deception,
in the name of his father were sufficient to condemn him forever.
And if not, then let them fight it out after he was dead and gone;
let his last will and testament be a ghost, a spectre that would strike
terror into their hearts and embitter such pleasure as they might
otherwise derive from life.</p>

<p>His will had been drawn up seven years ago; all that was needed
was the signature of the notary public.</p>

<p>But why did the Baron hesitate? Why did he pace back and
forth in his room with pinched lips? Why did he ring for the
butler with the idea of sending this functionary for the notary,
and then suddenly change his mind and give the butler something
else to do?</p>

<p><i>&#8220;D&eacute;p&ecirc;che-toi, mon bon gar&ccedil;on</i>,&#8221; screeched the parrot.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In the course of three days the Baroness had five talks with
her husband. Each time he rejected her petition to have the
affairs of their son straightened out; and when she became insistent
and seemed minded to keep up her fight, he became silent, speechless.</p>

<p>It was during her last attempt that the servants heard her speaking
with extraordinary passion and violence. When she left the
Baron&#8217;s room her whole body was quivering with emotion and
excitement. She came out, and ordered the house servants to pack
her trunk and her coachman to be ready to leave in a few
minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p><p>An hour later she was on her way to the estate at Siegmundshof,
about ten miles from the baronial residence. Her maid accompanied
her. But she was utterly unable to find peace there. During
the day she would pace back and forth through the rooms,
crying and wringing her hands; at night she would lie down, but not
to sleep. On the fourth day she returned to the city, had the
carriage driven to the residence of Count Urlich, and sent her
coachman in to get the Countess. Emilia came down, terrified, to
know what her mother wanted. The Baroness told her that she
wished her to accompany her to Herr Carovius, whose address
she had found in the city directory.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius had waited in vain for the news the Baroness
had promised him. His anger got the best of him: he decided to
make an example of the Auffenberg family, and, with this end in
view, entered their house as the personal embodiment of punitive
justice. When he was told that he could not be admitted, he
began once more to start trouble; he raged and stormed like a
madman. The servants came running out from all quarters;
finally a policeman appeared on the scene and questioned him.
The porter then dragged him from the house and out through the
big gate at the entrance to the grounds, where he stood surrounded
by a crowd of curious but not entirely disinterested people, bare-headed,
waving his arms and striking an imaginary adversary with
his fists&mdash;a picture, all told, of anger intensified to the point of
insanity.</p>

<p>His backers at once got wind of his fruitless attempts to collect.
They became uneasy, gave Herr Carovius himself a deal of trouble,
and finally appointed a lawyer to take charge of the case. In the
meantime Herr Carovius had learned through a spy that it had
come to a complete break between the Baron and the Baroness,
that the latter had left within two days with bag and baggage,
and that great consternation prevailed among the servants and
friends of the family.</p>

<p>A voluptuous light crept across Herr Carovius&#8217;s face: here was
defeat and despair, weeping and gnashing of teeth; what more
could he wish? He felt that he was personally the annihilator
of the collective aristocracy. And if it is possible to take a fiendish
delight in witnessing the destruction of what one after all despises,
how much greater may this joy be when the thing destroyed is
something one loves and admires!</p>

<p>It was while in this mood that the Baroness and her daughter
came to see him. The sight of the two women left him momentarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>speechless. He forgot to say good-day to them; to ask
them in never once occurred to him.</p>

<p>The Baroness wanted to know where Eberhard was: she was
determined to see him. When Herr Carovius stuttered out the
astounding information to her that he was living hardly more
than three hundred paces from where she was then standing, she
began to tremble and leaned against the wall. She was not prepared
for this: she had always imagined that he was staying at
some mysterious place in some mysterious distance.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius at once insisted that he accompany the ladies to
the Baron&#8217;s diminutive residence. But the Baroness felt that she
was not capable of this: she feared it would mean her death.
&#8220;Take me home with you, Emilia,&#8221; she said to her daughter, &#8220;and
you go over and have a talk with Eberhard first.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Emilia had not seen Eberhard once during the nine years
of her married life, and was even less inclined than her mother
to meet him now. Nor was it possible to take the Baroness to her
home. The old lady had evidently forgotten that she had told
Count Urlich never to show his face in her presence again. The
occasion of this inexorable request was the time she learned that
the governess of his child was in a family way and that he was
responsible for her disgrace.</p>

<p>Since the Baroness stoutly refused to return either to her town
residence or to Siegmundshof, there was nothing for Emilia to do
but to take her to a hotel. Herr Carovius, who had accompanied
the two women on the street and had enjoyed to the full their
pitiable distress, suggested that they go to the Bavarian Court. He
climbed up on the seat by the coachman, told him how to get
there, and looked down in regal triumph on the pedestrians.</p>

<p>Countess Emilia, quite at her wits&#8217; end, sent a telegram to her
Aunt Agatha. The next Wednesday Frau von Erfft with her
daughter Sylvia arrived. &#8220;Clotilda acts as if she had lost her
mind,&#8221; she said to Emilia after having spent an hour in the room
with her sister. &#8220;I am going to see your father. I must have a
long talk with Siegmund.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baron received his sister-in-law with marked coolness,
though he had always had a great deal of respect for her.</p>

<p>Frau von Erfft was quite careful to avoid any reference to the
family affairs. She talked about Sylvia, remarking that she was
now twenty-seven years old, and that she had rejected all her
suitors, a fact which was causing her parents a measure of concern.
&#8220;She simply will not be contented,&#8221; said Frau Agatha. &#8220;She is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>bent on securing a special mission in her marriage, and fears nothing
so much as the loss of her personal liberty. That is the way our
children are, dear Siegmund; and if we had brought them into
the world differently, they would be different. In our day the
ideal was obedience; but now children have discovered the duty
they owe themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they should look out for themselves,&#8221; replied the Baron
gloomily. He had fully appreciated what his sister-in-law was driving
at.</p>

<p>From the confused and incoherent remarks of her sister, Agatha
had learned what had taken place between the Baron and the
Baroness. She was familiar with the painful past; and when she
looked into the old Baron&#8217;s eyes, she saw what was necessary. She
made up her mind then and there to have Eberhard meet his
mother.</p>

<p>She wished above everything else to quiet Clotilda and persuade
her to return home. The task, owing to the weakness and instability
of the Baroness, was not difficult. Sylvia remained with
her aunt, and her quiet, resolute disposition had a wholesome effect
upon her. In the meantime Agatha had got Eberhard&#8217;s address.
After some search she found the house: Eberhard was at home.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The first talk she had with him passed off without results of
any kind. He evaded her courageous remarks, and failed to hear
what he did not care to hear. He was stiff, polite, and annoyingly
listless. Agatha, full of vexation, told her daughter of her disappointment.
Sylvia said she would like to go with her mother the
next time she visited Eberhard. Agatha shook her head, though
she was in no way minded to abandon her purpose.</p>

<p>There was no change at the Baron&#8217;s house. Baroness Clotilda
was in a perpetual state of nervous excitement that was anything
but reassuring either to herself or those about her. The Baron
was a disquieting riddle to the entire household: he never left his
room; he paced up and down hours at a time, with his hands folded
across his back.</p>

<p>Agatha called on her nephew a second, a third, a fourth time.
Even though Eberhard&#8217;s Arctic impenetrability seemed made for all
time, though yielding seemed to be no part of his nature, she
finally succeeded in jolting him loose from his bearings. And
when Sylvia accompanied her mother&mdash;Sylvia generally won her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>point with her mother&mdash;he shook off his armour with unexpected
suddenness; you could see the struggles that were going on in
his soul.</p>

<p>Falteringly, and in the affected and finical tone he not infrequently
adopted, he told the story of his youth, commenting on the
everlasting discord between his father and his mother and the
disagreeable quarrels that used to take place at home. He said
that just as soon as his mother would ask that something be done,
his father would demand the opposite. The children soon saw
that father was going his way and mother hers; they were not
unaware of the fact that their parents cordially distrusted each other
and even went so far as to lay traps for each other. He insisted
that his mother, with all her amiability and gentleness, was obsessed
with the idea of teasing, annoying, and wounding his father on
that very point where she had already and so often teased, annoyed,
and wounded him before; and that this lack of reason and consideration
on her part, coupled with the absence of kindness and
candour on his, had made the paternal home a hell, torn at the
hearts of the growing children, and in time so hardened them
that they suspected every friendly face they saw, and withdrew,
as if so from something vile, from every hand that was reached
out to them. He related further that in this loveless wilderness
brother and sister had been drawn to each other, that in Emilia&#8217;s
heart, and his own as well, this mutual friendship was cherished
as a sacred, inviolable possession, so sacred that it impelled them
in time to establish a league against all the rest of the world. How
did they conduct themselves once this league had been founded?
If they read a book it was in common; they kept no secrets from
each other, advised each other, and shared their happiness and
sorrow equally, until one fine day Emilia&#8217;s father appeared before
her, and informed her that Count Urlich had asked for her hand
and that he had promised that he should have it.</p>

<p>At this point in the story, Eberhard became silent; he bit his
lips; his ashen face, that had never before reminded Agatha so
much of the old Baron, betrayed an incurable grief.</p>

<p>Agatha was familiar with this incident, in rough outline; but
as Eberhard related it, it stirred her soul to the very depths. &#8220;One
must try to forget,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget? No, that I cannot do; never have been able to do.
Be it a matter of virtue or of vice, I cannot forget. Emilia, then
still half child and only half woman, was made flexible in time.
But that my mother did not do everything in her power to prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>this gruesome deed, and that it caused her to sink deeper and
deeper into the coils of domestic anguish by reason of her innate
and gnawing weakness&mdash;that was the bitterest experience of my
entire life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she is your mother, Eberhard. Never in the history of the
human family has a son had the right to condemn his mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is news to me,&#8221; replied Eberhard coldly. &#8220;Mothers are
human beings like any one else. Even mothers can commit a sin
by filling their children with the poison of distrust and disgust
with life. Father and mother, parents: they are a symbol, a
glorious one when they hover above us and around us, worthy of
respect and calling for filial veneration. But if I am bound to
them only by the ties of duty, they are not symbols; they are mere
phantoms, conceptions of human speech. There is no duty but the
duty of love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sylvia had sat in perfect silence. Unconsciously she had followed
the most beautiful law of harmonious souls: to wield an
influence, to have power, not through the use of words and the
elaboration of reasons, but by a pure life, an unquestioned existence.
Agreement and disagreement lay like a play of light and shadow on
her brow.</p>

<p>In this way she reminded Eberhard more and more of Eleanore.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the power of this memory that moved him to
promise that he would go with Agatha on the following day to
his mother. The sole condition he imposed was that he be assured
that he would not meet his father.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was relentless in this request, Frau von Erfft
conceded it, though she had a reassuring premonition that the events
and the hour would be stronger than will and purpose.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>On entering his mother&#8217;s boudoir, Eberhard&#8217;s eyes fell at once
on the alabaster clock, the face of which was supported by three
figures representing the daughters of time. In his childhood days
the clock had always had a highly poetic meaning to him: it
seemed to symbolise the fulfilment of his most ardent wishes.</p>

<p>The Baroness had been prepared for his coming by her sister.
While Eberhard and Sylvia had been standing in the corner room
waiting, a few of the servants had gathered at the door, where
they whispered to each other timidly.</p>

<p>Eberhard went up to his mother and kissed her hand. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>Baroness&#8217;s face was the colour of lead; her eyes were opened as
wide as possible, and yet she seemed hardly conscious. Emilia
stood at one side; her hands were pressed to her bosom, her fingers
were twitching convulsively.</p>

<p>Frau Agatha endeavoured to relieve the situation of its solemnity
and unnaturalness by making a few humorous remarks about
Eberhard&#8217;s hiding place on the hill by the Castle. Baroness
Clotilda looked at her son in anxious and uneasy suspense: &#8220;I
scarcely recognise him,&#8221; she said with a hoarse voice, &#8220;he has
changed so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have changed, too, Mother,&#8221; said Eberhard, as his chin
sought refuge between the lapels of his coat. He was as stiff as a
poker. Agatha looked at him full of vexation and annoyance.
He acted as though he were being bored by the meeting.</p>

<p>But it was only a mask. As he looked at the old, indistinct,
tired, bullied face, he became conscious of his mistake: he felt
that he was wrong in saying that &#8220;Mothers are also human beings.&#8221;
He saw at once that amends had to be made, that action was necessary;
he felt that his next step would lead to inevitable self-contempt
if he neglected the moral deed of repentance.</p>

<p>As he struggled with himself and stared, as if paralysed, into the
rebellion of his own soul, a certain pair of eyes had forced their
way behind the seeming apathy. A sudden blush came to Sylvia&#8217;s
cheeks: she went up to her cousin, and took him by the hand. He
quivered; he saw at once that she had divined what was going on
in his soul, and now she was determined to bring his fight to a
close, a final, definite close. She took him out of the room; he
followed her; she led him through the dining room, the reception
room, the smoking room, the library, and on to his father&#8217;s room.
Agatha, Emilia, and the Baroness looked at each other in amazement.
They went to the door of the room, and listened in breathless
suspense.</p>

<p>Sylvia opened the door rather boldly. The old Baron was
sitting on the leather chair before the stove. His legs were wrapped
in a blanket; the expression on his face was of stony coldness.</p>

<p>Hardly had he noticed the two when he sprang to his feet as
if the lightning had struck close by him. He shook; he faltered;
he groped about for a physical support; and from his throat there
came a stifled gurgle. That was all.</p>

<p>Eberhard walked over to him, and reached out his hand.</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as if the old man would collapse. A
last flash of hatred and revenge shot from his blue eyes; then he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>too reached out his hand. His arm trembled; thick knots of
quivering muscles formed on his cheeks. Sylvia had gently closed
the door and vanished.</p>

<p>Anxious minutes passed by and nothing happened, except that
each held the hand of the other and each looked into the eyes
of the other. The silence was broken only by the crackling of
the fire in the stove.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just at the right time,&#8221; murmured the old Baron, without
looking up and as if lost in meditation, &#8220;just at the right time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eberhard made no reply. He stood as still, as motionless, as
silent, and with his heels as close together as if he were a young
officer facing his superior in command.</p>

<p>After a while he wheeled about and slowly left the room.</p>

<p>Sylvia was waiting in the library. In the twilight it was possible
to see only the vague outline of her body.</p>

<p>Eberhard took hold of her and whispered: &#8220;I really believe that
I no longer have a father.&#8221;</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>That same night the old Baron had left. He got up in the
middle of the night; at four o&#8217;clock his valet accompanied him to
the station.</p>

<p>The next morning two letters were found lying on his writing
desk: one was addressed to Eberhard, the other to the Baroness.
The latter contained nothing more than a few words of farewell.
The former was more detailed. It expressed the Baron&#8217;s satisfaction
at the fact that Eberhard, whom he welcomed as the head
of the house, had returned, and plainly indicated that all the
necessary legal steps would be taken in a very short while to give
him complete authority as his heir and successor. The letter closed
with this surprising sentence: &#8220;So far as I am personally concerned,
I am planning to enter the Catholic Church, in order to spend the
remainder of my misapplied life at Viterbo in the Dominican
Convent of Della Guercia.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no explanation, no unusual display of feeling, no
confession, nothing but the naked fact.</p>

<p>The Baroness was neither surprised nor shocked. She fell into
a mute, melancholy brooding, and then said: &#8220;He never was happy,
never in his whole life. I never heard him laugh a really whole-souled
laugh; and living with him has made me forget how to
laugh myself. His heart has been from time immemorial a sort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>of convent, an abode of darkness, a place of sternness. He has
found his way home at last, and is probably tired from the long
journey on the way to his soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Clotilda!&#8221; cried Frau von Erfft. &#8220;What you say
about his laughing may be true, and a man who cannot laugh is
half animal. But do you mean to tell me that an intelligent
man must resort to such means to find peace with himself and his
God? A man who is under obligations to set an example for
others? Is there not enough darkness in men&#8217;s heads already?
Is it necessary to put out the torches of those who stand guard?
My sense of pardon is not so elaborate. I prefer to be a child
of the world and associate with those who are regarded as heathens,
and who have given us works of light and illumination.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words Eberhard entered. As she looked into his face,
Frau von Erfft thought: &#8220;There is another who can&#8217;t laugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baron&#8217;s change of religious views caused the greatest excitement
throughout the entire country. The liberal newspapers published
fulminatory articles; flaming protests were made in the clubs
against the surreptitious propaganda of Rome. The ultramontane
party leaders rejoiced and made capital out of the marvellous
return of such a sceptic to the bosom of the Church which alone
can save the souls of men: they used the case as a bait for fresh
recruits and as a means to fill the old regulars with greater fire
and enthusiasm. Through the homes blew a breath of a tyrannical
priesthood and spiritual gagging.</p>

<p>Eberhard adapted himself to his changed condition quickly and
with but little apparent effort: the chaos of opinions left him
virtually unmoved. To become the master of so much and so
many people, and to do it so suddenly, necessitated dignity, a clear
eye, and a firm hand. His being was in no danger from an excess
of zeal or up-start conceit, suffer though he might from too great
seriousness and his preference for a place in the shadow. Strangely
enough, the abundance of his responsibilities made him more
cheerful. And where he was unable to take his part in the world
of outward unrest, Sylvia&#8217;s influence interceded and made it possible
for him to do what was expected of him.</p>

<p>In May he accompanied her and her mother to Erfft. There
they took long walks together every day, and talked a great deal
about Eleanore. At first he spoke with noticeable reserve. But
when he felt that he had gained the confidence of his auditor,
and she his, he spoke quite candidly, so candidly in truth that
Sylvia came to look upon his action as one of inner liberation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p><p>When he told of Eleanore&#8217;s marriage to Daniel Nothafft, Sylvia
interrupted him, and asked a number of questions concerning
Daniel. &#8220;Oh, yes, he was our guest once; he is the Kapellmeister,&#8221;
she said. And then she told him all about Daniel&#8217;s visit at Erfft,
and did it with a smile in which there were both indulgence and
re-awakened astonishment.</p>

<p>Her smile made the same appeal to Eberhard that Eleanore&#8217;s had.
And yet, when he was in Sylvia&#8217;s company, he seemed to recognise
more distinctly than ever what had drawn him with such irresistible
power to Eleanore, possibly because Sylvia was of a less ardent and
forceful nature. He could not exactly express it in words; he
merely felt that it was the unknown realm of tones, the unknown
melting of melodies, the ringing order of the music transformed
into soul.</p>

<p>At the beginning of June, Sylvia went back to Nuremberg with
Eberhard and her parents. A few days later the betrothal took
place in the baronial residence.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Herr Carovius had been paid. The consortium of silent backers
had been dissolved.</p>

<p>Never in the history of finance had there been a satisfied creditor
who was so unhappy as Herr Carovius. He was without a goal,
and the sign posts had been destroyed. He had received his
money; so far so good. His share of the profit was something
over sixty thousand marks. But what was this in comparison with
the great noise? What comparison was there between living in
ease and the gorgeous sight of falling stars? What attraction
could the world offer him after this hopeful affair, which had
begun as a tragedy, and had increased in interest and suspense
until one was justified in believing that all the contradictory forces
in human nature were going to collide with one mighty bang,
when, in reality, the whole incident flattened out into an ordinary
drama of emotion, with the curtain going down on reconciliation
all around?</p>

<p>But this was not the sole reason why Herr Carovius, up until
this time a most elastic figure, one of those imperturbable bachelors
for whom no hurdle was too high, suddenly felt that he was
growing old. His soul was filled with unrest; he was seeing bad
omens; he feared there was going to be a change in the weather.</p>

<p>He felt an inner hunger, and yet he somehow lacked appetite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>for his kind of things. &#8220;Down and out, lost and no good,&#8221; he
sighed within. But those who had got rich at his expense could
not possibly succeed. This much he knew.</p>

<p>He began to lose his hair; he became rheumatic. As soon as
the thermometer began to fall he shivered; if it rained he stayed
at home. He began to study medicine, all by himself. He took
up the various remedies of our remote ancestors. He read the
works of Paracelsus, and declared that all those who had written
on medicine since Paracelsus were quacks and poison-mixers.</p>

<p>His ideas with regard to music became also more and more
strange and bizarre. He had discovered an old Nuremberg composer
by the name of Staden. His opera entitled &#8220;Seelewig&#8221;&mdash;the
first of all German operas, by the way&mdash;he insisted was the
very zenith of musical art, eminently superior to Mozart and Bach.
He played arias and melodies from &#8220;Seelewig&#8221; to Dorothea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, when you can get that,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;when you come
to the point where I can see from your playing what is in it and
at the bottom of it, Heaven and Hell in one stroke of the bow,
then, you little jackanapes, I&#8217;m going to make you my heiress.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was precisely what Dorothea had been longing to hear;
it confirmed her calculations and crowned her dreams. To hear
these words roll from her uncle&#8217;s tongue had been her ambition;
and she had spared no pains to arrive at her goal.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius was not spoiled. Since the days his sister had
kept house for him, no woman had ever concerned herself about
him in the least. But at that time he was young; and he had
wheedled himself into believing that the women were merely
waiting for him, that all he had to do was to beckon to them
with his finger and they would come rushing up to him in battalions.
But because he had dreaded the idea of making an unhappy
selection, and by reason of the expense of the enterprise,
he had neglected to give the necessary signal, and hence had
been so generous as to leave them in complete possession of their
freedom.</p>

<p>He never knew until now that the soft, little hand of a woman
could bring out effects as if they had come from the touch of a
magic wand. &#8220;What a pleasant little phiz D&ouml;derlein&#8217;s offspring
has,&#8221; he thought. And if Dorothea, who had made him believe
that she was visiting him on the sly, though her father had given
his consent long ago, chanced to remain away for a few days, he
would become wild with rage, and go into the kitchen and chop
wood merely to enjoy the sensation of destroying something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p><p>Moreover, the music lessons Dorothea was taking at Herr Carovius&#8217;s
expense gave the girl a new conception of her art, and
awakened in her a measure of wholesome ambition. Satisfied as
he was with her docility and her progress, Herr Carovius referred
to her at times as the coming female Paganini, and pictured himself
in the r&ocirc;le of a demoniacal impresario.</p>

<p>But the thing about Dorothea that struck him most forcibly and
filled him with such astonishment was her relation to mirrors.</p>

<p>A mirror exercised a tremendous influence on her. If she passed
by one, her face became coloured with a charming blush of desire;
if she stood before one and saw her picture reflected in it, she
was filled, first with sexual unrest, and then with retreating uncertainty.
In the brightness of her eyes there was always a longing
for the mirror. Her gait and her gestures seemed to have duties
imposed on them by the mirror; it seemed to be their task to
prepare surprises. Her whole body seemed to live in common with
a spectral mirror sister, and to catch sight of this beloved sister
was her first wish, fulfilment of which she effected as often as
possible.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Dorothea had succeeded in making it clear to her father that
it would be highly advantageous to her, as the nearest relative, to
show Herr Carovius every conceivable favour. Andreas D&ouml;derlein
baulked at first; but he could not refuse recognition to the far-seeing
penetration of his daughter.</p>

<p>When she told him of her appearance in the baronial residence,
and mentioned the enormous sum Herr Carovius had collected
with the mien of an undaunted victor, D&ouml;derlein became serious;
he stared into space and did some hard thinking. Recalling the
now superannuated feud, he preserved the appearance of inapproachability,
and said: &#8220;We will not debase ourselves for the sake
of Mammon.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few days later, however, he said, quite of his own free will,
sighing like a man who has gone through some great moral struggle
and come out of it victorious, &#8220;Well, do as you think best, my
child, but don&#8217;t let me know anything about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>His argument, had he expressed it in so many words, would have
been something like the following: We are poor; we are living
from hand to mouth. The negligible dowry Herr Carovius gave
his sister has been used up. Marguerite would have been perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>justified in putting in her claim for thirty thousand marks, but
Herr Carovius settled with her for only twelve thousand, and
there was no possibility of redress. For Herr Carovius had
wheedled his sister into giving him a written statement that she
was satisfied with the sum of twelve thousand: the remaining
eighteen thousand was the price he demanded in return for her
consent to have his sister, who was slavishly submissive to him,
marry the man of her choice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been duped,&#8221; said Andreas D&ouml;derlein, and bore up
under his grudge with becoming dignity.</p>

<p>The director of the conservatory died, and Andreas D&ouml;derlein,
who, by virtue of his achievements and his personality, had the
first right to the vacant position, was appointed to it. His former
colleagues were stout in their contention that the appointment cost
him many a bitter visit to the powers that be. D&ouml;derlein read envy
in their eyes and smiled to himself.</p>

<p>But it was a hard life. &#8220;Art cannot live without bread,&#8221; said
D&ouml;derlein, with a heroic glance into the future. &#8220;But oh, what
works I could bring out if I only had time! Give me time, time,
and,&#8221; swinging his hands cloudward, &#8220;the eagles above would
greet me!&#8221;</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Herr Carovius and death were intimate friends. Whenever
death had an errand to run, it always knocked on Herr Carovius&#8217;s
door, as if to find a person who approved of its deeds and who
had a just appreciation of them, for there were so many of the
other kind.</p>

<p>But when Herr Carovius heard that Eleanore Nothafft had died,
he felt that his old friend had gone a bit too far. He was
touched. He was seized with griping pains in the abdominal
region, and locked himself up for the period of one whole day in
his court room. There he was taken down with catalepsy; his face
went through a horrible transformation: it came to look as if all
the wickedness, hopelessness, and despair of the man who had never
become reconciled to life through love had been concentrated in it
and petrified.</p>

<p>His forebodings had come true.</p>

<p>Eleanore&#8217;s funeral took place on a rainy June day. Herr Carovius,
dressed in his shabby old yellow raincoat with its big pockets,
was present. There were also many others present. Every face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>was touched with grief; every eye was filled with tears, like the
earth round about. Those who had not known her had at least
heard of her. They had known that she had been there in some
capacity, just as one hears of some unusual phenomenon among the
celestial bodies, and that she was gone; that she was no more to be
seen. For one moment at least all these people were changed
into deep, seeing, feeling beings; for one moment they laid aside
their fruitless activities, their petty misdeeds, desires, anxieties,
and vanities, and became conscious of the fact that the truth, purity,
love, and loveliness of this earth had been decreased.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius went home and made a lime-blossom tea; such
a tea had often helped him when he had not felt well.</p>

<p>The rain dripped down on the kitchen window sill. Herr
Carovius said to himself: &#8220;That is my last funeral.&#8221;</p>

<p>Along in the evening Dorothea came in and after her Philippina
Schimmelweis. Herr Carovius had paid her many a penny for her
services as a spy, and now she wanted to hear what he had to say
to this last and greatest of misfortunes. His infatuated interest
in everything Eleanore did had been a source of unmitigated
pleasure to her, though she had been exceedingly cautious never to
let him see how she felt about it all. On the contrary, she never
failed to affect a hypocritical seriousness in the face of all his
questions, orders, instructions, and caustic observations. She had
egged him on; she had flattered him; she had used every opportunity
to fan the flames of his ridiculous hopes. Owing to this the
confidence between the two had grown to considerable proportion;
the man&#8217;s senile madness, born of his love for Eleanore, had even
aroused Philippina&#8217;s lewd lasciviousness.</p>

<p>She said she would have to be going home; the child was
asleep; and though she had locked the front door, you could never
tell what was going to happen over there. &#8220;My God,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;things take place in that house that are never heard of in any
other home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The presence of Dorothea disturbed and annoyed her. She sat
down on the kitchen bench, and looked at the young girl with
poison in her eyes. Dorothea on the other hand found it painfully
difficult to conceal her disgust at the mere sight of Philippina:
her ugliness defied descriptive adjectives. Dorothea never took
her eyes off the creature who sat there talking in a screeching
voice, and who, as if her normal unattractiveness were not enough,
had her head bandaged.</p>

<p>The fact is that Philippina had the toothache; for this reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>her face was wrapped in a loud, checkered cloth, while out from
underneath her hat stuck two little tassels.</p>

<p>She told the story of Eleanore&#8217;s death with much satisfaction
to herself, and with that delight in the tragic in which she revelled
by instinct. &#8220;And now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;old Jordan sits over there in
his attic rooms and sobs, and Daniel goes moping about, refusing
to eat any food and looking at you with eyes that would fill you
with fear even if everything else was as it should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the point to which Daniel has brought things, she
showed in her gratuitous report, in which there was an attempt
to chide him for his waywardness: He has put two women under
the ground, has a helpless child in the house, is out of a job, is
not making a cent. Now what could this kind of doings lead to?
Judge R&uuml;bsam&#8217;s wife had paid the funeral expenses. Why, you
know, Daniel didn&#8217;t even know what they were talking about
when the bill came in, and old Jordan, he didn&#8217;t have twenty
marks to his name. She swore she wasn&#8217;t going to stand for it
much longer, and if Daniel didn&#8217;t quit his piano-strumming&mdash;he
wasn&#8217;t getting a cent for it&mdash;she was going to know a thing or
two.</p>

<p>Quite contrary to his established custom, Herr Carovius failed
to show the slightest interest in her gabble; at least he made no
concessions to her. Nor did he fuss and fume; he gazed into
space, and seemed to be thinking about many serious things all at
the same time. His silence made Philippina raging mad. She
jumped up and left without saying good-bye to him, slamming
first the room door and then the hall door behind her.</p>

<p>Dorothea was standing by the piano rummaging around in some
note books. Her thoughts were on what she had just been
hearing.</p>

<p>She remembered Daniel Nothafft quite well. She knew that
there was an irreconcilable feud between him and her father.
She had seen him; people had pointed out the man with the angry
looking eyes to her on the street. She had felt at the time as if
she had already talked with him, though she could not say when
or where. She had a vague idea as to what people said about him,
and she knew that he was looked upon in the city as the adversary
of evil himself.</p>

<p>Her breast was filled with an aimless longing. Her blood
began to run warm, the fusty <i>milieu</i> in which she just then chanced
to be cleared up and began to bestir itself. She took her violin
and began to play a Hungarian dance, while an enlivening smile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>flitted across her face, and her eyes shone with the audacity of an
ambitious and temperamental girl.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius raised his head: &#8220;Tempo!&#8221; he exclaimed,
&#8220;Tempo!&#8221; and began to beat time with his hands and stamp the
floor with his feet.</p>

<p>Dorothea smiled, shook her head, and played more and more
rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tempo,&#8221; howled Herr Carovius. &#8220;Tempo!&#8221;</p>

<p>The barking of a sad dog was wafted into the room from the
court below. It was C&aelig;sar: he was on his last legs.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Daniel&#8217;s mother had come; she had brought little Eva along.</p>

<p>Marian had learned of Eleanore&#8217;s death through the newspaper.
No one had thought of her; no one had written to her.
She had not read it in the newspaper herself. The doctor in
Eschenbach, who had subscribed to the <i>Fr&auml;nkischer Herold</i>, had
read it one morning, and had given her the paper with considerable
hesitation, calling her attention to the death notice.</p>

<p>She was not present at the funeral. But she went out to the
cemetery and prayed by Eleanore&#8217;s grave.</p>

<p>She appreciated Daniel&#8217;s loss. When she met him he was
precisely as she thought he would be. She recognised her son in
his great grief and mute despair: he was nearer to her then than at
any other time of his life. She honoured his grief; she did not
need to decrease it or divert it. She was silent, just as Daniel
himself was silent. All she did was to lay her hand on his forehead
occasionally. He murmured: &#8220;Mother, oh Mother!&#8221; She
replied: &#8220;Now don&#8217;t! Don&#8217;t think of me!&#8221;</p>

<p>She said to herself: &#8220;When an Eleanore dies in the full bloom
of youth, one must mourn until the soul of its own accord again
grows hungry for life.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first Eva had tried to play with her little step-sister; but
Philippina had chased her from the room. Once she turned
against the enraged daughter of Jason Philip Schimmelweis, and
said: &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell my father on you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes? You&#8217;ll tell your father? Well, tell him! Who cares?&#8221;
replied Philippina scornfully. &#8220;But who is your father? What
is he? Where is he? In Pomerania perhaps?&#8221; Whereupon she
added in a sing-song voice: &#8220;Pomerania is burnt to the ground.
Fly, cockchafer, fly!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;My father? He&#8217;s in the room there,&#8221; replied Eva surprised
and offended: &#8220;I am in his house, and little Agnes is my sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina tore open her eyes and her mouth: &#8220;Your father&mdash;is
in the room&mdash;&#8221; she stammered, &#8220;and little Agnes&mdash;is your sister?&#8221;
She got up, seized Eva by the shoulders, and dragged her
across the floor into the room where Daniel and Marian were
sitting. With an outburst of laughter that sounded as though
she were not quite in her right mind, and with an expression of
impudence and rage on her face, she panted forth her indignation
in the following terms: &#8220;This brat says Daniel is her father and
Agnes is her sister! A scurvy chit&mdash;I&#8217;ll say!&#8221;</p>

<p>Marian, terrified, sprang to her feet, ran over to Eva, and
began to scream: &#8220;Let her go, take your hands off that child!&#8221;
Eva was pale, the tears were rolling down her cheeks, her little
arms were stretched out as if in urgent need of help from an
older hand. Philippina let go of her and stepped back. &#8220;Is it
really true?&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;is it really true?&#8221; Marian knelt
down and picked up her foster child: &#8220;Now you mind your own
business, you rogue,&#8221; she said to Philippina.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel?&#8221; Philippina turned to Daniel with uplifted arms, and
repeated, &#8220;Daniel?&#8221; She seemed to be challenging him to speak;
and to be reproaching him for having deceived her. There was
something quite uncanny about the way she said, &#8220;Daniel?
Daniel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You go back and mind Agnes!&#8221; said Daniel, worried as he had
never been before: he felt more than ever under obligations to
Philippina. And what could he do now without her? She was
the sole guardian of his child. His mother could not remain in
the city; she had to make her living, and that she could do only
over in Eschenbach. Her business was located there; and there
Eva was growing up in peace and happiness. On the other hand,
he did not feel that it would be possible or advisable to take
Agnes away from Philippina, even if his mother saw fit to adopt
her too. Philippina was attached to the child with an ape-like
affection. And more than this: Who would take care of old Jordan
if Philippina were discharged? Daniel could not make his
bed or get his meals.</p>

<p>Philippina went out. &#8220;The damned scoundrel!&#8221; she said as soon
as she had left the room. She clenched her horny fists, and continued
Daniel&#8217;s life history: &#8220;The brute has a bastard, he has.
You wait, you little chit, and the first chance I get I&#8217;ll scratch
your eyes out!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p><p>Taking the child on her lap, Marian sat down by Daniel&#8217;s
side. &#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, Eva, don&#8217;t cry; we&#8217;re going back home now in a
minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel looked at his mother most attentively, and told her how
Philippina had chanced to come into his family. He told her all
about Jason Philip&#8217;s attempt to rob him of his inheritance, and
how his own daughter had betrayed him; how his father had
taken three thousand talers to Jason Philip; how Jason Philip
had been forced to hand over a part of the money when Jordan
was in trouble because of his son; and how he had waived his
claims to the rest of the money.</p>

<p>Marian&#8217;s head sank low on her breast. &#8220;Your father was a
remarkable man, Daniel,&#8221; she said after a long silence, &#8220;but he
never did understand people; and the person whom he misunderstood
most of all was his wife. He was like a man who is blind,
but who does not want to let it be known that he is blind: he
walks around, but where does he go? He stands still and has not
the faintest idea where he is. And by the way, Daniel, it seems
to me that you are a little bit like him. Open your eyes, Daniel,
I beg you, open your eyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>The child in her lap had fallen asleep. Daniel looked into
Eva&#8217;s face&mdash;yes, he opened his eyes&mdash;and as he saw this delicate,
sweet, charming countenance so close before him, he could no
longer control himself. He turned to the wall, and cried as if
his heart would break: &#8220;I am a murderer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Daniel,&#8221; said Marian gently, &#8220;or if you are, then everybody
who lives is a murderer, the dead of the past being the
victims.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel writhed in agony and gnashed his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father is in the room there,&#8221; whispered Eva in her dreams.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>The hardest of all for Marian was to get along with old
Jordan; for he was only a shadow of his former self. He never
entered Daniel&#8217;s room; if Marian wanted to see him she went
upstairs, and there he sat, quiet, helpless, extinguished, a picture
of utter dereliction.</p>

<p>He never mentioned his sorrows; it made him restless to see that
Marian sympathised with him. When she did, he became quite
courteous; he even tried to act the part of a man of the world.
The effect of this assumed sprightliness, seen from the background
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>of his physical impoverishment and spiritual decay, was
terrifying.</p>

<p>Marian hoped to hear something from him concerning Daniel&#8217;s
present situation. She knew, in a general way, that he was
in profound distress, that he was living in most straightened circumstances,
and this worried her tremendously. But she wanted
to know how he stood in the world; whether people felt there
was anything to him; and whether music was something from which
a man could make a decent living. On this last point her distrust
was as strong as ever; her fear showed no signs of weakening.
It was Eleanore, and she only, that had given her a measure of
confidence: it seemed that Eleanore&#8217;s disposition, her very presence,
had inspired her with a vague, far-away idea of music. But now
Eleanore was gone, and all her old doubts returned.</p>

<p>Jordan however became painfully secretive whenever she referred
to Daniel. He seemed to be grieved at the mere mention
of his name. He would merely look at the door, tuck his hands
up his coat-sleeves, and draw his head down between his shoulders.</p>

<p>Once he said: &#8220;Can you explain to me, my good woman, why
I am alive? Can you throw any light on such a preposterous
paradox as my present existence? My son&mdash;a wretch, vanished
without a trace, so far as I am concerned no longer living. My
daughters, both of them, in the grave; my dear wife also. I have
been a man, a husband, and a father; that is, I have <i>been</i> a father!
My existence scorns the laws and purposes of nature. To eat, to
drink, to sleep&mdash;oh, what repulsive occupations! And yet, if I
do not eat, I get hungry; if I do not drink, I get thirsty; if I do
not sleep, I get sick. How simple, how aimless it all is! For me
the birds no longer sing, the bells no longer ring, the musicians
have no more music.&#8221;</p>

<p>Owing to her desire to find consolation of some kind and at
any price, she turned to Eberhard and Sylvia; they were now
visiting Daniel almost every day. She liked them; there was so
much consideration for other people in their behaviour, so much
delicacy and refinement in their conversation. Sylvia was not in
the least offended by Daniel&#8217;s sullen silence; she treated him with
a respect and deference that made Marian feel good; for it was
proof to her that in the eyes of good and noble people Daniel
stood in high esteem. The Baron seemed in some mysterious way
to be continually talking about Eleanore, though he never mentioned
her name. There was a sadness in his eyes that reminded
her of Eleanore; there was something supersensuous in its power.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>Marian often felt as though this strange nobleman and her son
were brothers and at the same time enemies, as seen in the light
of painful memories. Sylvia also seemed to have the same feeling;
but she found nothing objectionable in the relation.</p>

<p>One day, as Marian accompanied the two to the hall door, she
decided to pick up her courage; and she did. &#8220;Well, how do you
think he is going to make out?&#8221; she asked; &#8220;he has no work; as
a matter of fact he never speaks of work. What will that lead to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been thinking about that,&#8221; replied Sylvia, &#8220;and I
believe a way has been found to help him. He will hear about it
in a short while. But he must not suspect that we have anything
to do with it.&#8221; She looked at her fianc&eacute;; he nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>Eberhard and Sylvia knew perfectly well from the very beginning
that there could be no thought of lending Daniel money.
Gifts, large or small, merely humiliated him; they disgraced him.
It was a case where eagerness to serve on the part of those who
have meets with insurmountable obstacles, whether they wish to
be lavish in their generosity or of seeming calculation. There was
no use to appeal to delicacy; attenuating provisos would not help;
small deceptions practised in the spirit of love would prove ineffectual.
Riches stood face to face with poverty, and was as helpless
as poverty usually is when obliged to enter the lists against riches.
The case was striking, but not unique.</p>

<p>Having made up her mind to come to the assistance of the
musician, Sylvia turned to her mother. But it was idle to count
on the backing of the Baroness: Andreas D&ouml;derlein had so poisoned
her mind against Daniel that the mere mention of his name caused
her brow to wrinkle, her lips to drop.</p>

<p>Agatha von Erfft got in touch, by letter, with some business
people who were in a position to give her some practical advice.
Their assistance was helpful in that it at least saved her the invaluable
time she might have lost by appealing to the wrong people.
One day she appeared before Eberhard and Sylvia with her plans
all drawn up.</p>

<p>One of the most reputable music houses of Mayence had been
nursing the idea for years of bringing out a pretentious collection
of medi&aelig;val church music. A great deal of material had already
been assembled under the supervision of a writer on musical subjects
who had recently died. But there was still much to be collected.
To do this, it would be necessary to go on long journeys,
and these would entail the expenditure of a good deal of money.
Moreover, it was necessary to find a man who would not be afraid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>of the work attached to the undertaking, and on whose judgment
one could rely without doubt or cavil. Owing to the fact that the
expenses up to the present had far exceeded the initial calculations,
and since it seemed impossible to engage the right sort of man
to place in charge of the work, the publisher had become first
sceptical and then positive; positive that he would invest no more
money in it.</p>

<p>Agatha had heard of this some time ago. That the enterprise
might be revived she learned from direct inquiry; indirect investigation
confirmed what she had been told. But the publisher was
unwilling to assume all the financial responsibility; he was looking
for a patron who would be disposed to invest capital in the plan.
If such a person could be found, he was willing to place Daniel
Nothafft, whose name was now known to him, in the responsible
position of making the collections and editing them. There would
be a good deal of work connected with the undertaking: the treasures
of the archives, libraries, and convents would have to be investigated;
corrections would have to be made; notes would have to be
written; and the entire work would have to be seen through the
press. To do this would take several years. The publisher consequently
insisted that whoever was placed in charge should sign a
contract to remain until the work had been finished, he in turn
agreeing to pay the editor a salary of three thousand marks a
year.</p>

<p>Eberhard made careful inquiries as to the standing of the firm,
and finding that it enjoyed a rating well above the average, he
agreed to furnish the requisite capital.</p>

<p>A few days after the conversation between Sylvia and Marian,
Daniel received a letter in the morning mail from Philander and
Sons, requesting him to accept the position, a detailed description
of which was given. In the event of his acceptance, all he had to
do was to sign the enclosed contract.</p>

<p>He read the letter carefully and quietly from beginning to
end. His face did not brighten up. He walked back and forth
in the room a few times, and then went to the window and looked
out. &#8220;It seems to rain every day this summer,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Marian had returned to the table. She took the letter with
the enclosed contract and read both of them. Her heart beat with
joy, but she was exceedingly careful not to betray her state of
mind to Daniel: she was afraid of his contradictory and crotchety
disposition. She hardly dared look at him, as she waited in anxious
suspense to see what he would do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p><p>Finally he came back to the table, made a wry face, stared at
the letter, and then said quite laconically: &#8220;Church music? Yes,
I will do it.&#8221; With that he took his pen, and scrawled his name
to the contract.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God,&#8221; whispered Marian.</p>

<p>That afternoon they left Daniel. Eva hung on her father&#8217;s
neck, quite unwilling to leave him. Without the least display of
shyness, she kissed him many times, laughing as she did so. She
was overflowing with a natural and whole-hearted love for him.
Daniel offered no resistance. He looked serious. As his eye
caught that of the child, he shuddered at the abundant fulness of
her life; but he was aware at the same time of a promise, and
against this he struggled with all the power there was in him.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>It was a sunny day in September. Eberhard, who had spent the
entire August at Erfft, had returned to the city to attend to some
urgent business&mdash;and also to hasten the arrangements for his coming
wedding.</p>

<p>As the streets were filled with playing children, he sauntered
along on his way up to the Castle on the hill. He wanted to look
up his little house; he had not been in it for months. He had a
feeling that he would enjoy the quiet up there; he longed to
look back over and into scenes from the past; he wanted to pass in
review the shadowy pictures of his former self; pictures he saw
before him wherever he went, wherever he was. One of these
was always with him; if he found himself in a certain room it
was there; if he went on a long journey it was with him. He
even found it on the faded pages of books he had taken to himself
as companions in his loneliness.</p>

<p>He hesitated from time to time, stopped, and seemed quite
irresolute. All of a sudden he turned around, and started back
with hasty steps to &AElig;gydius Place. Just as he was entering the
hall of Daniel&#8217;s apartment, he met Daniel coming out. He
greeted Eberhard and gave him his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just going to call for you,&#8221; said the Baron. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you
come with me up to my old hermitage?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel looked out through his glasses at a swallow that was just
then circling around over the square; there was something fabulous
in its flight. &#8220;To tell you the truth, Baron, I have very little
inclination to gossip at present.&#8221; He made the remark with as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>much consideration for the laws of human courtesy as lay within
his power.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be no gossiping,&#8221; said Eberhard. &#8220;I have a great
secret, one that I can tell you without saying a word.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel went along with him.</p>

<p>The air in the little house was dead, stuffy. But Eberhard
did not open the windows; he wished to have it as quiet as it was
when they entered. Daniel took a seat on one of the chairs in
the former living room of the Baron. Eberhard thought he had
sat down because he was tired; he therefore took a seat opposite
him. The evening sun cast a slanting ray on an old copper engraving
based on a scene from pastoral life. A mouse played around
in the corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is your secret?&#8221; asked Daniel brusquely, after they
had sat in perfect silence for some time.</p>

<p>Eberhard got up, and made a gesture which meant that Daniel
was to follow him. They crossed the narrow hall, climbed up
a pair of small steps, and then Eberhard opened a door leading
into the attic room.</p>

<p>A stupefying, deadening odour of decayed flowers struck them
in the face. Involuntarily Daniel turned to go, but the Baron
pointed at the walls in absolute silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this? What kind of a room is this?&#8221; asked Daniel,
rather forcibly.</p>

<p>The four walls of the room were completely covered with
bouquets, garlands, and wreaths of withered flowers. The leaves
had fallen from most of them, and were now lying scattered about
the floor. Leaves that had once been green had turned brown; the
grasses and mosses were in shreds, the twigs were dry and brittle.
Many of the bouquets had had ribbons attached to them; these,
once red or blue, were now faded. Others had been bound with
gold tinsel; this had rusted. The slanting rays of the sun fell on
others, and lighted them as it had shone on the copper engraving
in the room below. Through the purple rays could be seen a
dancing stream of dust.</p>

<p>It was a flower mausoleum; a vault of bouquets, a death-house of
memories. Daniel suspected what it all meant. He felt his
tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth; a chill ran over him.
And when Eberhard at last began to speak, his eyes filled with hot,
gushing tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;The flowers were all picked and bound by her hands, by Eleanore&#8217;s
hands,&#8221; said Eberhard. And then, after a pause: &#8220;She prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>the bouquets for a florist, and I bought them; she had no
idea who bought them.&#8221; That was all he said.</p>

<p>Daniel looked back into his past life, as if an invisible arm
were drawing him to the pinnacle of some high mountain. He
looked, and his soul was dissolved in anxiety, torture, and repentance.</p>

<p>What had he left? Two graves: that was all. No, he had,
aside from the two graves, a broken harp, some withered flowers,
and a mask of terracotta.</p>

<p>He looked at the dead stems and withered chalices: Eleanore&#8217;s
fingers had once touched all of these. Her fingers were even then
hovering over the dead buds like figures from the realm of spirits.
In the dusty spider webs hung caught at present unused moments,
kind words that were never spoken, consolation that was never
expressed, encouragement, consideration, and happiness that were
allowed to pass unclaimed and unapplied. Oh, this living and not
knowing what the present contains! Oh, this being with a living
life, and remaining unaware of it! This failure to avail one&#8217;s
self of a wonderful day, a breathing, pulsing hour! This dragging,
falling, plunging into the night of desire and delusion, this
proud, vain, criminal discontent! O winged creature, winged
creature, where art thou! Where can one call out to thee!</p>

<p>There was nothing left but two graves, a broken harp, withered
flowers, and a mask! And a fair child here, a foul one there, and
a third that had come into life only to die! And up above all
this, up above even the tip of the mountain top, the gigantic, the
inexpressible, the sea of dreams and dreamed melodies, the breath
of God, the annunciation of infernal darkness, the message of
eternity, the wonders of temporal existence, dance and dancing
pipes, peals of thunder, and sweet weavings of sound&mdash;Music!</p>

<p>It was evening. The Baron closed the door. Daniel reached him
his hand in silence, and then went home.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span><a name="THE_PROMETHEAN_SYMPHONY" id="THE_PROMETHEAN_SYMPHONY"></a>THE PROMETHEAN SYMPHONY</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">During</span> the following autumn and winter, Daniel lived a quiet,
lonely life. In the spring, Sylvia von Auffenberg wrote him a
letter, asking him to come over to Siegmundshof and spend a few
weeks with her and Eberhard. He declined, though he promised
to come later.</p>

<p>Old Herold visited him occasionally. He told all about the
friction in the conservatory since D&ouml;derlein had been in charge,
and contended that the world was on the point of turning into a
pig-stye.</p>

<p>Herr Seelenfromm also came in from time to time, while
among other visitors were the architect who had a defect in his
speech and Martha R&uuml;bsam. Toward the close of the winter Herr
Carovius also called. Socially he had become more nearly possible
than he had been in former years. He still held, however, some
very remarkable views about music.</p>

<p>Whatever any of the visitors said went in one of Daniel&#8217;s ears
and out of the other. It would often happen that there would
be a number of people in his presence, and he would seem to be
listening to them; and yet if you watched his face, you could see
that he was completely absent-minded. If some one turned to
him with a question, he would not infrequently smile like a child,
and make no effort whatsoever to respond. No one had ever noticed
him smile this way before.</p>

<p>He returned the money Philippina had loaned him at the time
the piano was pawned. Philippina said: &#8220;Oi, oi, Daniel, you seem
to be swimming in money!&#8221; She brought him the receipt, and
then took the money to her room, where she did a lot of figuring
to see whether the interest had been accurately calculated.</p>

<p>Little Agnes was sitting on the floor, sucking a stick of candy.
She was always happy when Philippina was around; she was afraid
of her father.</p>

<p>Friends had told him that his apartment was too large now;
he was advised to give it up and take a smaller one. He became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>enraged; he said he would never do this voluntarily, for the house
meant a great deal more to him than merely so many rented
rooms; and he insisted that everything be left just as it was.</p>

<p>One day at the beginning of spring he said to Philippina: &#8220;I
am going away for a long time. Watch the child, and don&#8217;t let
the old man upstairs suffer for anything. I will send you the
money to keep up the house on the first day of each month, and
you will be held responsible for everything that takes place.
Moreover; I want to pay you a set wage: I will give you five talers
a month. There is no reason why you should work for me for
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shaking and shuddering that Daniel had often had occasion
to notice in Philippina returned. She shrugged her shoulders,
looked as mean as only she could, and said: &#8220;Save your coppers;
you&#8217;ll need &#8217;em; you mustn&#8217;t try to act so rich all of a sudden;
it ain&#8217;t good for your health. If you have any money to spend,
go out and git Agnes a pair of shoes and a decent dress.&#8221; Daniel
made no reply.</p>

<p>Her greediness in money matters had certainly not diminished
since the day she began to pilfer from her parents. She loved
money; she adored the shining metal; she liked to see it and feel
it; she liked to take bank notes in her hands and caress them. It
gave her intense pleasure to think that people looked upon her as
being poor when she was actually carrying more than a thousand
marks around in an old stocking stuffed down in her corset between
her breasts. She loved to hear people complain of hard
times. When a beggar reached out his hand to her on the street,
she felt that he was doing it as an act of homage to her; she would
cause her bosom to heave so that she might feel the presence of
the stocking more keenly. She was pleased to think that one so
young had made herself so secure against future eventualities of
any kind.</p>

<p>She felt, despite all this, like scratching Daniel&#8217;s eyes out when
he spoke of paying her regular monthly wages. This she regarded
as base ingratitude. If it were at all possible for grief to
find ineradicable lodgment in her envious, unenlightened, malicious
soul, Daniel&#8217;s offer of so much per month made it so.</p>

<p>She ran into the kitchen, and hurled knives and forks in the
sink. She went to old Jordan&#8217;s room, knocked on his door, and
made him open it; then she told him with all the anger at her
resourceful command that Daniel was going away. &#8220;There is
hardly a cent in the house, and he&#8217;s going on a jamboree!&#8221; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>exclaimed. &#8220;There is some damned wench back of this. Go tell
him, Herr Inspector, go tell him what a dirty thing it is he&#8217;s
doing&mdash;going away and leaving his child and his old father in the
lurch. Do it, Herr Inspector, and you&#8217;ll get potato dumplings,
ginger-bread, and sauce for dinner next Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jordan looked at Philippina timidly. His mouth watered for the
food she had promised him; for she was holding him down to a
near-starvation diet. He was often so hungry that he would sneak
into the delicatessen shop, and buy himself ten pfennigs&#8217; worth of
real food.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will make inquiry as to the reason for his going,&#8221; murmured
Jordan, &#8220;but I hardly believe that I will be able to move him one
way or the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you go out and take a little walk; git a bit of fresh
air,&#8221; commanded Philippina; &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to straighten up your room.
Your windows need washing; you can&#8217;t see through &#8217;em for dirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Late that evening Daniel came up to say good-bye to Jordan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked the old man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see a little of the German Empire,&#8221; replied Daniel.
&#8220;I have some business to attend to up in the North, in the cities
and also out in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck to you,&#8221; said Jordan, much oppressed, &#8220;good luck
to you, my dear son. How long are you going to be gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know yet; possibly for years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For years?&#8221; asked Jordan. He looked at the floor; he tried to
keep his eyes on the floor under his feet: &#8220;Then I suppose we
might as well say good-bye forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel shook his head. &#8220;It makes no difference when I return,
I will find you here,&#8221; he said with a note of strange assurance in
his voice. &#8220;When fate has treated a man too harshly, there seems
to come a time when it no longer bothers him; it evades him, in
fact. It seems to me that this is the case with you: you are quite
fateless.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jordan made no reply. He opened his eyes as if in fear, and
sighed.</p>

<p>The next morning Daniel left home. He wore a brown hunting
jacket buttoned close up to his neck with hartshorn buttons. Over
this hung a top-coat and a cape. His broad-brimmed hat overshadowed
his face, which looked young, although so serious and distracted
that voices, glances, and sounds of any kind seemed to
rebound from it like swift-running water from a smooth stone wall.</p>

<p>Philippina carried his luggage to the station. Her dress was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>literally smothered in garish, gaudy ribbons. The women in the
market-place laughed on seeing her until they got a colic.</p>

<p>When Daniel took leave from her and boarded the train, she
did not open her mouth; she wrinkled her forehead, rubbed the
ends of her fingers against each other, stood perfectly quiet, and
looked at the ground. Long after the train had left the station,
she was still to be seen standing there in that unique position. A
station official went up to her, and, with poorly concealed ridicule
at the rare phenomenon, asked her what she was waiting for.</p>

<p>She turned her back on him, and started off. She came back by
way of St. James&#8217;s Place, and talked for a quarter of an hour with
her friend Frau Hadebusch. It was Sunday. Benjamin Dorn was
just coming home from church. Seeing Philippina, he made a
profound bow.</p>

<p>Frau Hadebusch slapped Philippina on the hip, and smiled at
her knowingly.</p>

<p>Herr Francke was no longer living at Frau Hadebusch&#8217;s: he was
in jail. He had promised to marry the cook of a certain distinguished
family; but instead of hastening the coming of the happy
day, he had gambled away the savings of his bride-to-be.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Daniel had a letter of introduction to the Prior of the Monastery
at L&ouml;hriedt. He was looking for a manuscript that was supposed
to have been written by a contemporary of Orlando di
Lasso, if not by Di Lasso himself.</p>

<p>He remained for over two months, working at his collection.
He found his association with the monks quite agreeable, and they
liked him. One of them, who held him in especially high regard
because of his ability as an organist, gave him to understand that it
was a matter of unaffected regret to him that he could not greet
him, Protestant that he was, with the confidence that a man of his
singular distinction deserved.</p>

<p>&#8220;So! I wish I were a Jew,&#8221; said Daniel to him, &#8220;then you would
have a really unqualified opportunity to see what God can do
without your assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The monk in question was called Father Leonhard; he was a
short, wiry fellow with black eyes and a dark complexion. He
seemed to have had a great deal of experience with the world, and
to have no little cause for contrition and repentance: there was
nothing conventional about his religious practices; they were, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>the contrary, of almost redundant fervour and renunciation. Daniel
was impressed by the man&#8217;s faith, though his soul shuddered
when in his presence: he regarded him as an enemy, a Philistine,
and preferred not to look at him at all.</p>

<p>He lived close by the monastery in the house of a railroad
official. Father Leonhard came in to visit him once. Daniel was
sitting by the window busily engaged in making some corrections.
The Father looked about the room: his eyes fell on a round,
wooden box lying on a chair; it looked like a cake box.</p>

<p>&#8220;The people at home have sent you something to nibble at,&#8221;
remarked the Father, as Daniel got up.</p>

<p>Daniel riveted his eyes on the monk, took the box, hesitated for
a while, and then opened it. In it, carefully packed in sawdust,
was the mask of Zingarella. It was a part of Daniel&#8217;s meagre luggage;
wherever he went it followed him.</p>

<p>Father Leonhard sprang back terrified. &#8220;What does that mean?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means sin and purification,&#8221; said Daniel, holding the mask up
in the light of the setting sun. &#8220;It means grief and redemption,
despair and mercy, love and death, chaos and form.&#8221;</p>

<p>From that day on, Father Leonhard never said another word to
Daniel Nothafft. And whenever the strange musician chanced to
play the organ, the monk arose as quickly as possible, left the
church, and sought out some place where the tones could not
reach him.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>That summer Daniel came to Aix-la-Chapelle and the region of
Li&eacute;ge, Louvain, and Malines. From there he wandered on foot to
Ghent and Bruges.</p>

<p>In places where he had to make investigations, he was obliged
to depend upon the letters he received from his publisher to make
himself understood. Condemned to silence, he lived very much
alone; he was a stranger in a strange land.</p>

<p>He had no interest in sights. It was rare that he looked at old
paintings. The beautiful never caused him to stop unless it actually
blocked his way. He went about as if in between two walls.
He followed his nose, turned around only with the greatest reluctance,
and never felt tired until he was ready to lie down to
sleep.</p>

<p>And even when he was tired the feeling that he was being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>robbed of something gnawed at his soul; he was restless even when
he slept. Haste coloured his eye, fashioned his step, and moulded
his deeds. He ate his meals in haste, wrote his letters in haste,
and talked in haste.</p>

<p>It pained him to feel that men were looking at him. Although
he invariably sought out the most deserted corner of whatever inn
he chanced to stop at, and thereby avoided becoming, so far as he
might, the target of the curious, he was nevertheless gaped at,
watched, and studied wherever he went. For everything about
him was conspicuous: the energy of his gestures, the agility of his
mimicry, the way he showed his teeth, and the nervous, hacking
step with which he moved through groups of gossiping people.</p>

<p>He had anticipated with rare pleasure the sight of the sea. He
was prepared to behold the monstrous, titanic, seething, and surging
element, the tempest of the Apocalypse. He was disappointed by
the peaceful rise and fall of the tide, the harmless rolling back
and forth of the waves. He concluded that it were better for one
not to become acquainted with things that had inspired one&#8217;s fancy
with reverential awe.</p>

<p>He could quarrel with nature just as he could quarrel with men.
The phases of nature which he regarded as her imperfections excited
his anger. He was fond, however, of a certain spot in the
forest; or he liked a tree in the plain, or sunset along the canal.</p>

<p>He liked best of all the narrow streets of the cities, when the
gentle murmurings of song wafted forth from the open windows,
or when the light from the lamp shone forth from the windows
after they had been closed. He loved to pass by courts and cellars,
gates and fences; when the face of an old man, or that of a young
girl, came suddenly to view, when workmen went home from the
factories, or soldiers from the barracks, or seamen from the harbours,
he saw a story in each of them; he felt as one feels on reading
an exciting book.</p>

<p>One day when he was in Cleve he walked the streets at night
all alone. He noticed a man and a woman and five children, all
poorly dressed, standing near a church. Lying before them on the
pavement were several bundles containing their earthly possessions.
A man came up after a while and addressed them in a stern,
domineering tone; they picked up their bundles and followed him:
it was a mournful procession. They were emigrants; the man had
told them about their ship.</p>

<p>Daniel felt as if a cord in his soul had been made taut and
were vibrating without making a sound. The steps of the eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>people, as they died away in the distance, developed gradually into
a rhythmical, musical movement. What had been confused became
ordered; what had been dark shone forth in light. Weighed down
with heaviness of soul, he went on, his eyes fixed on the ground
as if he were looking for something. He no longer saw, nor
could he hear. Nor did he know what time it was.</p>

<p>After a year and a half of congealed torpidity, the March wind
once more began to blow in his soul.</p>

<p>But it was like a disease; he was being consumed with impatience.
His immediate goal was the cloister of &#338;sede at Osnabr&uuml;ck, and
from there he wanted to go to Berlin. He could not bear to sit
in the railway carriages: in Wesel he placed his trunk on a freight
train, and went from there on foot, his top-coat hung over his
arm, his knapsack strapped across his back. Despite the inclement
weather he walked from eight to ten hours every day. It was
towards the end of October, the mornings and evenings were
chilly, the roads were muddy, the inns were wretched. This did
not deter him from going on: he walked and walked, sought and
sought, often until late at night, passionately absorbed in himself.</p>

<p>When he came to the coal and iron district, he raised his head
more and more frequently. The houses were black, the earth and
the air were black, blackened men met him on the road. Copper
wires hummed in the fog and mist, hammers clinked, wheels
hummed, chimneys smoked, whistles blew&mdash;it was like a dream
vision, like the landscape of an unknown and accursed star.</p>

<p>One evening he left a little inn which he had entered to get
something to eat and drink. It was eight miles to Dortmund, where
he planned to stay over night. He had left the main road, when
all of a sudden the fire from the blast-furnaces leaped up, giving
the mist the appearance of a blood-red sea. Miners were coming
in to the village; in the light of the furnaces their tired, blackened
faces looked like so many demoniac caricatures. Far or near, it
was impossible to say, a horse could be seen drawing a car over
shining rails. On it stood a man flourishing his whip. Beast, man,
and car all seemed to be of colossal size; the &#8220;gee&#8221; and &#8220;haw&#8221;
of the driver sounded like the mad cries of a spectre; the iron
sounds from the forges resembled the bellowing of tormented
creatures.</p>

<p>Daniel had found what he had been looking for: he had found
the mournful melody that had driven him away the day Eleanore
died. He had, to be sure, put it on the paper then and there,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>but it had remained without consequence: it had been buried in
the grave with Eleanore.</p>

<p>Now it had arisen, and its soul&mdash;its consequence&mdash;had arisen
with it; it was expanded into a wonderful arch, arranged and
limbed like a body, and filled as the world is full.</p>

<p>Music had been born to him again from the machine, from
the world of machinery.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Jason Philip Schimmelweis had been obliged to give up his
house by the museum bridge. He could not pay the rent; his
business was ruined. By a mere coincident it came about that the
house on the Corn Market had a cheap apartment that was vacant,
and he took it. It was the same house in which he lived when he
made so much money twenty years ago.</p>

<p>Was Jason Philip no longer in touch with modern business
methods? Had he become too old and infirm to make the public
hungry for literary nourishment? Were his advertisements without
allurement, his baits without scent? No one felt inclined to
buy expensive lexicons and editions de luxe on the instalment plan.
The rich old fellows with a nose for dubious reading matter never
came around any more. Jason Philip had become a dilatory
debtor; the publishers no longer gave him books on approval; he
was placed on the black list.</p>

<p>He took to abusing modern writers, contending that it was no
wonder that the writing of books was left exclusively to good-for-nothing
subjects of the Empire, for the whole nation was suffering
from cerebral atrophy.</p>

<p>But his reasoning was of no avail; his business collapse was imminent;
in a jiffy it was a hard reality. A man by the name of
Rindskopf bought his stock and furnishings at brokers&#8217; prices, and
the firm of Jason Philip Schimmelweis had ceased to exist.</p>

<p>In his distress Jason Philip appealed to the Liberal party. He
boasted of his friendship with the former leader of the party,
Baron von Auffenberg, but this only made matters worse: one
renegade was depending upon the support of another. This was
natural: birds of a feather flock together.</p>

<p>Then he went to the Masons, and began to feel around for their
help; he tried to be made a member of one of the better lodges.
He was given to understand that there was some doubt as to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>loyalty of his convictions, with the result that the Masons would
have none of him.</p>

<p>For some time he found actual difficulty in earning his daily
bread. He had resigned his position with the Prudentia Insurance
Company long ago. Ever since a certain interpellation in
the Reichstag and a long lawsuit in which the Prudentia became
involved, and which was decided in favour of its opponents, the
standing of the company had suffered irreparably.</p>

<p>Jason Philip had no other choice: he had to go back to bookbinding;
he had to return to pasting, cutting, and folding. He
returned in the evening of his life, downcast, impoverished, and
embittered, to the position from which he had started as an ambitious,
resourceful, stout-hearted, and self-assured man years ago.
His eloquence had proved of no avail, his cunning had not helped
him, nor his change of political conviction, nor his familiarity
with the favourable turns of the market, nor his speculations. He
had never believed that the order of things in the world about
him was just and righteous, neither as a Socialist nor as a Liberal.
And now he was convinced that it was impossible to write a
motto on the basis of business principles that would be fit material
for a copy book in a kindergarten.</p>

<p>Willibald was still the same efficient clerk. Markus had got a
job in a furniture store, where he spent his leisure hours studying
Volap&uuml;k, convinced as he was that all the nations of the earth
would soon be using this great fraternal tongue.</p>

<p>Theresa moved into the house on the Corn Market with as much
peace and placidity as if she had been anticipating such a change
for years. There was a bay window in the house, and by this she
sat when her work in the kitchen was done, knitting socks for her
sons. At times she would scratch her grey head with her knitting
needle, at times she would reach over and take a sip of cold,
unsugared coffee, a small pot of which she always kept by her side.
Hers was the most depressed face then known to the human family;
hers were the horniest, wrinkliest peasant hands that formed part
of any citizen of the City of Nuremberg.</p>

<p>She thought without ceasing of all that nice money that had
passed through her hands during the two decades she had stood
behind the counter of the establishment in the Plobenhof Street.</p>

<p>She tried to imagine where all the money had gone, who was
using it now, and who was being tormented by it. For she was
rid of it, and in the bottom of her heart she was glad that she
no longer had it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p><p>One day Jason Philip came rushing from his workshop into her
room. He had a newspaper in his hand; his face was radiant with
joy. &#8220;At last, my dear, at last! I have been avenged. Jason
Philip Schimmelweis was after all a good prophet. Well, what
do you say?&#8221; he continued, as Theresa looked at him without any
noticeable display of curiosity, &#8220;what do you say? I&#8217;ll bet you
can&#8217;t guess. No, you will never be able to guess what&#8217;s happened;
it&#8217;s too much for a woman&#8217;s brain.&#8221; He mounted a chair, held
the paper in his hand as if it were the flag of his country, waved
it, and shouted: &#8220;Bismarck is done for! He&#8217;s got to go. The
Kaiser hates him! Now let come what may, I have not lived in
vain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jason Philip had the feeling that it was due to his efforts that
the reins of government had been snatched from the hands of
the Iron Chancellor. His satisfaction found expression in blatancy
and in actions that were thoroughly at odds with a man of his age.
He held up his acquaintances on the street, and demanded that they
offer him their congratulations. He went to his favourite caf&eacute;,
and ordered a barrel of beer for the rejuvenation of his friends.
He delivered an oration, spiced with all the forms of sarcasm
known to the art of cheap politics and embellished with innumerable
popular phrases, explaining why he regarded this as the happiest
day of his eventful life.</p>

<p>He said: &#8220;If fate were to do me the favour of allowing me to
stand face to face with this menace to public institutions, this
unscrupulous tyrant, I would not, believe me, mince matters in the
slightest: I would tell him things no mortal man has thus far
dared say to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Several months passed by. Bismarck, then staying at his country
place in Sachsenwald and quarrelling with his lot, decided to visit
Munich. There was tremendous excitement in Nuremberg when it
was learned that he would pass through the city at such and such
an hour.</p>

<p>Everybody wanted to see him, young and old, aristocrats and
humble folk. Early in the morning the whole city seemed to be
on its feet, making its way in dense crowds out through the
King&#8217;s Gate.</p>

<p>This was a drama in which Jason Philip had to play his part:
without him it would be incomplete. &#8220;To look into the eyes of
a tiger whose claws have been chopped off and whose teeth have
been knocked out is a pleasure and a satisfaction that my mother&#8217;s
son dare not forego,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p><p>His elbows stood him in good stead. When the train pulled
into the station, our rebel was standing in the front row, having
pushed his way through the seemingly impenetrable mass of
humanity.</p>

<p>The train stopped for a few minutes. The Iron Chancellor
left his carriage amid deafening hurrahs from the assembled multitude.
He shook hands with the Mayor and a few high-ranking
army officers.</p>

<p>Jason Philip never budged. It never occurred to him to shout
his own hurrah. An acidulous smile played around his mouth, his
white beard quivered when he dropped the corners of his lips in
satanic glee. It never occurred to him to take off his hat, despite
the threatening protests all too audible round about him. &#8220;I am
consistent, my dear Bismarck, I am incorruptible,&#8221; he thought to
himself.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;the satisfaction which we have described as satanic
seemed somehow or other to be ill founded: it was in such marked
contrast to the general enthusiasm. What had possessed this imbecile
pack? Why was it raging? It saw the enemy, the hangman,
right there before it, immune to the law, dressed in civilian
clothes, and yet it was acting as though the Messiah had come to
town on an extra train!</p>

<p>Jason Philip had the feeling that Bismarck was looking straight
at him. He fancied that the fearfully tall man with the unusually
small head and the enormously blue eyes had taken offence at
his silence. He feared some one had told him all about his political
beliefs.</p>

<p>The scornful smile died away. Jason Philip detected a lukewarm
impotency creeping over his body. The sweat of solicitude
trickled down across his forehead. Involuntarily he kneed his way
closer to the edge of the platform, threw out his chest, jerked his
hat from his head, opened his mouth, and cried: &#8220;Hurrah!&#8221;</p>

<p>He cried hurrah. The Prince turned his face from him, and
looked in another direction.</p>

<p>But Jason Philip had cried hurrah.</p>

<p>He sneaked home shaking with shame. He drew his slippers,
&#8220;For the tired Man&mdash;Consolation,&#8221; on his feet. They had become
quite worn in the course of his tempestuous life. He lay down on
the sofa with his face to the wall, his back to the window and
against the world.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p><h3>V</h3>

<p>Daniel had been in Berlin for weeks. He had been living a
lonely life on the east side of the gigantic city. One of the
managers of Philander and Sons came to see him. He returned
the call, and in the course of two hours he was surrounded, contrary
to his own will, by a veritable swarm of composers, directors,
virtuosos, and musical critics.</p>

<p>Some had heard of him; to them he appeared to be a remarkable
man. They threw out their nets to catch him, but he slipped
through the meshes. Unprepared, however, as he was for their
schemes, he could not help being caught in time. He had to give
an account of himself, to unveil himself. He found himself under
obligations, interested, and so forth, but in the end they could
not prevail against him: he simply passed through them.</p>

<p>They laughed at his dialect and his rudeness. What drew them
to him was his self-respect; what annoyed them was his secretiveness;
what they found odd about him was the fact that, try as
they might to associate with him, he would disappear entirely
from them for months at a time.</p>

<p>A divorced young woman, a Jewess by the name of Regina
Sussmann, fell in love with him. She recognised in Daniel an
elemental nature. The more he avoided her the more persistent
she became. At times it made him feel good to come once again
into intimate association with a woman, to hear her bright voice,
her step more delicate, her breathing more ardent than that of men.
But he could not trust Regina Sussmann; she seemed to know too
much. There was nothing of the plant-like about her, and without
that characteristic any woman appealed to him as being unformed
and uncultured.</p>

<p>One winter day she came to see him in his barren hall room in
Greifswald Street. She sat down at the piano and began to
improvise. At first it was all like a haze to him. Suddenly he
was struck by her playing. What he heard made a half disagreeable,
half painful impression on him. He seemed to be familiar
with the piece. She was playing motifs from his quartette, his
&#8220;Eleanore Quartette&#8221; as he had called it. It came out that
Regina Sussmann had been present at the concert given in Leipzig
three years ago when the quartette was performed.</p>

<p>After a painful pause Regina began to ask some questions that
cut him to the very heart. She wanted to know what relation,
if any, the composition bore to actual life. She was trying to lift
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>the veil from his unknown fate. He thrust her from him. Then
he felt sorry for her: he began to speak, with some hesitation, of
his symphony. There was something bewitching, enchanting in
the woman&#8217;s passionate silence and sympathy. He lost himself,
forgot himself, disclosed his heart. He built up the work in words
before her, pictured the seven movements like seven stairs in the
tower of a temple, a glorious promenade in the upper spheres, a
tragic storm with tragically cheerful pauses of memory and meditation,
all accompanied by laughing genii that adorned and crowned
the pillars of the structure of his dreams.</p>

<p>He went to the piano, began playing the melancholy leading
motif and the two subsidiary themes, counterpointed them, ran
into lofty crescendos, introduced variations, modulated and sang at
the same time. The pupils of his eyes became distended until
they shone behind his glasses like seas of green fire. Regina
Sussmann fell on her knees by the piano. It may be that she was
so affected by his playing that she could not act otherwise; and
it may be that she wished thereby to give him visible proof of her
respect and adoration. All of a sudden the woman became repulsive
to him. The unleashed longing of her eyes filled him with
disgust. Her kneeling position appealed to him as a gesture of
mockery and ridicule: a memory had been desecrated. He sprang
to his feet and rushed out of the room, leaving her behind and
quite alone. He never said a word; he merely bit his lips in
anger and left. When he came back home late that night, he
was afraid he might meet her again; but she was not there. Only
a letter lay on the table by the lamp.</p>

<p>She wrote that she had understood him; that she understood he
had been living in the past as if in an impregnable fortress, surrounded
by shadows that were not to be dispelled or disturbed
by the presumption of any living human being. She remarked
that she had neither intention nor desire to encroach upon his
peace of mind, that she was merely concerned for his future, and
was wondering how he would fight down his hunger of body
and soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shameless wretch,&#8221; cried Daniel, &#8220;a spy and a woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>She remarked, with almost perverse humility, that she had recognised
his greatness, that he was the genius she had been waiting for,
and that her one desire was to serve him. That is, she wished
to serve him at a distance, seeing that he could not endure her
presence. She implored him to grant her this poor privilege, not
merely for his own sake, but for the sake of humanity as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p><p>Daniel threw the letter in the stove. In the night he woke
up with a burning desire for delicate contact with an untouched
woman. He dreamed of a smile on the face of a seventeen-year-old
girl innocently playing around him&mdash;and shuddered at himself
and the thought of himself.</p>

<p>Shortly after this he went to Dresden, where he had some
work to do in the Royal library.</p>

<p>People came to him anxious to place themselves at his service.
Many signs told him that Regina Sussmann was making fervent
propaganda for him.</p>

<p>One day he received a letter from a musical society in Magdeburg,
asking him to give a concert there. He hesitated for a long
while, and then agreed to accede to their wish. Outwardly it
could not be called an unusually successful evening, but his auditors
felt his power. People with the thinnest smattering of music
forgot themselves and became infatuated with his arms and his
eyes. An uncertain, undetermined happiness which he brought to
the hearts of real musicians carried him further along on his
career. For two successive winters he directed concerts in the
provincial towns of North Germany. He was the first to accustom
the people to strictly classical programmes. It is rare that the
first in any enterprise of this kind reaps the gratitude of those
who pay to hear him. Had he not desisted with such Puritanical
severity from feeding the people on popular songs, opera selections,
and favourite melodies, his activity would have been much better
rewarded. As it was, his name was mentioned with respect, but he
passed through the streets unacclaimed.</p>

<p>Regina Sussmann was always on hand when he gave a concert.
He knew it, even if he did not see her. At times he caught sight
of her sitting in the front row. She never approached him.
Articles redolent with adulation appeared in the papers about him:
it was manifest that she had been influential in having them
written. Once he met her on the steps of a hotel. She stopped
and cast her eyes to the ground; she was pale. He passed by her.
Again he was filled with longing to come into intimate contact
with an untouched woman. Was his heart already hungry, as she
had predicted? He bit his lips, and worked throughout the whole
night. He felt that he was being fearfully endangered by the
prosy insipidity of the age and the world he was living in. But
could he not escape the terrors of such without having recourse to
a woman? The shadows receded, enveloped in sorrow, Gertrude
and Eleanore, wrapped in the embrace of sisters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; they cried. He saw at once that his provincial concerts
were leading him to false goals, enflaming false ambitions,
robbing him of his strength. He no longer found it possible to
endure the sight of brilliantly lighted halls, and the over-dressed
people who came empty and left untransformed. It all seemed
to him like a lie. He desisted; he threw it all overboard just
as the temptation was strongest, just as the Berlin Philharmonic
invited him to give a concert of his own works in its hall.</p>

<p>He had suddenly disappeared. In less than three months his
name had become a saga.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>He spent the summer, autumn, and winter of 1893 wandering
around. Now he was in a remote Thuringian village, now in some
town in the Rh&ouml;n region, now in the mountains of Saxony, now
in a fishing village on the Baltic. Throughout the day he worked
on his manuscripts, in the evening he composed. No one except
the members of the firm of Philander and Sons knew where he
was. He did not dare hide himself from the people who were
sending him the cheque at the end of the month.</p>

<p>He gradually became so unaccustomed to talking that it was
only with difficulty that he could ask a hotel-keeper about the price
of his room. This unrelieved silence chiselled his lips into
ghastly sharpness.</p>

<p>He never heard from his mother or his children. He seemed
to have forgotten that there were human beings living who thought
of him with affection and anxiety.</p>

<p>The only messages he received from the world were letters that
were forwarded to him at intervals of from four to five weeks
by the musical firm in Mayence. These letters were written by
Regina Sussmann, though they were not signed in her name: the
signature at the close of each one was &#8220;The Swallow.&#8221; She
addressed Daniel by the familiar <i>Du</i>, and not by the more conventional
and polite <i>Sie</i>.</p>

<p>She told him of her life, wrote of the books she had read, the
people she had met, and gave him her views on music. Her
communications became in time indispensable to him; he was
touched by her fidelity; he was pleased that she did not use her
own name. She had a remarkable finesse and power of expression,
and however ungenuine and artificial she may have appealed to
him in personal association, everything she wrote seemed to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>to be natural and convincing. She never expressed a wish that
he do something impossible and never uttered a complaint. On
the other hand, there was a passion of the intelligence about her
that was quite new to him; she was unlike the women he had
known. And there was a fervour and certainty in her appreciation
of his being before which he bowed as at the sound of a
higher voice.</p>

<p>Though he never answered her letters, he looked forward to
receiving them, and became impatient if one were overdue. He
often thought of the swallow when he would step to the window
on a dark night. He thought of her as an all-seeing spirit that
hovered in the air. The swallow&mdash;that was fraught with meaning&mdash;the
restless, delicate, swift-flying swallow. And in his mind&#8217;s
eye he saw the swallow that hovered over &AElig;gydius Place when
Eberhard came to take him up to the room with the withered
flowers.</p>

<p>He wrote to Philippina: &#8220;Decorate my graves. Buy two wreaths,
and lay them on the graves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must mount to the clouds, Daniel, otherwise you are
lost,&#8221; was one passage in one of the letters from the Swallow.
Another, much longer, ran: &#8220;As soon as you feel one loneliness
creeping over you, you must hasten into another, an unknown one.
If your path seems blocked, you must storm the hedges before
you. If an arm surrounds you, you must tear yourself loose, even
though it cost blood and tears. You must leave men behind and
move above them; you dare not become a citizen; you dare not
allow yourself to be taken up with things that are dear to you;
you must have no companion, neither man nor maid. Time must
hover over you cold and quiet. Let your heart be encased in
bronze, for music is a flame that breaks through and consumes all
there is in the man who created it, except the stuff the gods have
forged about their chosen son.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why should the picture of this red-haired Jewess, from whom
Daniel had fled in terror, not have vanished? There was a Muse
such as poets dream of! &#8220;Jewess, wonderful Jewess,&#8221; thought
Daniel, and this word&mdash;Jewess&mdash;took on for him a meaning, a
power, and a prophetic flight all its own.</p>

<p>&#8220;The work, Daniel Nothafft, the work,&#8221; wrote this second Rahel
in another letter, &#8220;the rape of Prometheus, when are you going to
lay it at the feet of impoverished humanity? The age is like
wine that tastes of the earth; your work must be the filter. The
age is like an epileptic body convulsed with agonies; your work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>must be the healing hand that one lays on the diseased brow.
When will you finally give, O parsimonious mortal? when ripen,
tree? when flood the valley, stream?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the tree was in no hurry to cast off the ripened fruit; the
stream found that the way to the sea was long and tortuous; it
had to break through mountains and wash away the rocks. Oh,
those nights of torment when an existing form crashed and fell
to the earth in pieces! Oh, those hundreds of laborious nights in
which there was no sleep, nothing but the excited raging of many
voices! Those grey mornings on which the sun shone on tattered
leaves and a distorted face, a face full of suffering that was always
old and yet new! And those moonlight nights, when some one
moved along singing, not as one sings with joy, but as the heretics
who sat on the martyr benches of the Inquisition! Then there
were the rainy nights, the stormy nights, the nights when it
snowed, and when he chased after the phantom of a melody that
was already half his own, and half an incorporeal thing wandering
around in boundless space under the stars.</p>

<p>Each landscape became a pale vision: bush and grass and flower,
like spun yarn seen in a fever, the people who passed by, and
the clouds fibrillated above the forests were of one and the same
constituency. Nothing was tangible; the palate lost its sense of
taste, the finger its sense of touch. Bad weather was welcome; it
subdued the noises, made men quieter. Cursed be the mill that
clappers, the carpenter who drives the nails, the teamster who calls
to his jaded pair, the laughter of children, the croaking of frogs,
the twittering of birds! An insensate man looks down upon the
scene, one who is deaf and dumb, one who would snatch all clothing
and decorations from the world, to the end that neither colour
nor splendour of any description may divert his eye, one who
mounts to heaven at night to steal the eternal fire, and who burrows
in the graves of the dead by day&mdash;an outcast.</p>

<p>In the beginning of spring, he started on the third movement,
an andante with variations. It expressed the gruesome peace that
hovered over Eleanore&#8217;s slumbering face one night before her
death. The springs within him were all suddenly dried up; he
could not tell why his hand was paralysed, his fancy immobile.</p>

<p>One evening he returned from a long journey to Arnstein, a
little place in Lower Franconia, where he had then pitched his
tent. He was living in the house of a seamstress, a poor widow,
and as he came into the room he noticed her ten-year-old daughter
standing by the open box in which he had kept the mask of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>Zingarella. Out of a perfectly harmless curiosity the child had
removed the lid, and was standing bewitched at the unexpected
sight.</p>

<p>When Daniel&#8217;s eyes fell on her, she was frightened; her body
shook with fear; she tried to run away. &#8220;No, no, stay!&#8221; cried
Daniel. He felt the emaciated body, the timidly quivering figure,
and a distant memory sunk its claws deep into his breast. The
mouth of the mask seemed to speak; the cheeks and forehead shone
with a brilliant whiteness. And as he turned his eyes away there
was a little elf dancing over him; and this little elf aroused a
guilty unrest in his heart.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Philippina would not permit little Agnes to play with other
children.</p>

<p>One day the child went out on to the square, and stood and
watched some other children playing a game known as &#8220;Tailor,
lend me the scissors.&#8221; She was much pleased at the sight of them,
as they ran from tree to tree and laughed. She would have been
only too happy to join them, but no one thought of asking the
pale, shy little creature to take part. Philippina, seeing her, rushed
out like a fury, and cried in her very meanest voice: &#8220;You come
back here in the house, or I&#8217;ll maul you until your teeth will
rattle in your mouth for three days to come!&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina also disliked to have Jordan pay any attention to
Agnes. If he did not notice that he was making her angry by
talking with the child, she would begin to sing, first gently, and
then more and more loudly. If this did not drive the old man
away, she would unload some terrific abuse on him, and keep at
it until he would get up, sigh, and leave. He did not dare
antagonise her, for if he did, she would penalise him by giving
him poor food and reduced portions. And he suffered greatly
from hunger. He was making only a few pennies a week, and had
to save every bit of it, if possible, so as to defray the expenses
he was incurring while working on his invention.</p>

<p>He had unbounded faith in his invention; his credulity became
stronger and stronger as the months rolled by. He could not be
discouraged by seeming failure. He was convinced, on the contrary,
that each failure merely brought him so much nearer the
desired goal.</p>

<p>He said to Philippina: &#8220;Why is it that you object to my playing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>once in a while with my little grand-daughter? It gives me so
much pleasure; it diverts me; it takes my mind off of my troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crazy nonsense,&#8221; replied Philippina. &#8220;Agnes has had trouble
enough with her father. Her grandfather? whew! That beats me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another time the old man said: &#8220;Suppose we make an agreement:
let me have the child a half-hour each day, and in return
for that I&#8217;ll run your errands down town.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina: &#8220;I&#8217;ll run my own errands. Agnes belongs to me.
That settles it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And yet Philippina was in an especially good humour about
this time. Benjamin Dorn, like Herr Zittel, had left the Prudentia,
and obtained a position with the Excelsior. He was taking
unusual interest in Philippina. In a dark hour, Philippina had
told her friend, Frau Hadebusch, that she had saved a good deal
of money, and, equipped with this bit of earthly wisdom, Frau
Hadebusch had gone to the Methodist, told him all about it, and
put very serious matrimonial ideas in his head.</p>

<p>Benjamin Dorn took infinite pains to gain Philippina&#8217;s good
graces. He was, to be sure, somewhat dismayed at having her
blasphemous system of theology dinned into his ears. He shook
his head wearily when she called him a sky-pilot and declared
right out that all this sanctimonious stuff was damned rot, and that
the main thing was to have a fat wallet. In this philosophy Frau
Hadebusch was with her to the last exclamation point. She had
told Benjamin Dorn that a doughtier, bonnier, more capable
person than Fr&auml;ulein Schimmelweis was not to be found on this
earth, and that the two were as much made for each other as oil
and vinegar for a salad. She said: &#8220;You simply ought to see the
dresses the girl has and how she can fix herself up when she wants
to go out. Moreover, she comes of a good family. In short,
any man who could get her would be a subject for real congratulations.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Philippina Frau Hadebusch said: &#8220;Dorn&mdash;he can write as
no one else on this earth. Oh, you ought to see him swing a pen!
He limps a little, but what of it? Just think how many people
go around on two sound legs, but have their heads all full of
rubbish! But Dorn! He&#8217;s whole cloth and a yard wide! He&#8217;s
as soft as prune juice. Why, when a dog barks at him, he gives
the beast a lump of sugar. That&#8217;s the kind of a man he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>In October Benjamin Dorn and Philippina went to the church
fair, and naturally took Agnes along. Benjamin Dorn knew what
was expected of him. He had Philippina take two rides on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>merry-go-round, paid her way into the cabinet of wax figures, and
took a chance on the lottery. It was a blank. He then explained
to Philippina that it was immoral to have anything to do with
lotteries, and bought her a bag of ginger snaps; and that was solid
pleasure.</p>

<p>Philippina acted very nicely. She laughed when nothing amusing
had taken place, rolled her eyes, spoke with puckered lips,
shook her hips when she walked, and never lost a chance to show
her learning. As they were coming home on the train, she said
she felt she would like to ride in a chaise, but there would have
to be two horses and a coachman with a tile hat. Benjamin Dorn
replied that that was not an impossible wish, suggesting at the same
time in his best brand of juvenile roguishness that there was a
certain solemn ceremony that he would not think of celebrating
without having a vehicle such as she had described. Philippina
giggled, and said: &#8220;Oi, oi, you&#8217;re all right.&#8221; Whereupon Benjamin
Dorn, grinning with embarrassment, looked down.</p>

<p>Then they took leave of each other, for Agnes had fallen asleep
in Philippina&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>How Philippina actually felt about the attention he was showing
her would be extremely difficult to tell, though she acted as
if she felt honoured and flattered. Benjamin Dorn was by no
means certain of himself. Frau Hadebusch did all she could to
bring Philippina around, but every time she made a fresh onslaught
Philippina put her off.</p>

<p>But Philippina had never sung as she had been singing recently,
nor had she ever been so light and nimble of foot. Every day
she put on her Sunday dress and trimmed it with her choicest
ribbons. She washed her hands with almond soap, and combed
her hair before the mirror. Bangs had gone out of fashion, so
she built her hair up into a tower and looked like a Chinese.</p>

<p>She visited Herr Carovius occasionally, and always found him
alone, for Dorothea D&ouml;derlein had been sent by her father to
Munich to perfect herself in her art. In broken words, with
blinking eyes, from a grinning mouth and out of a dumb soul, she
told Herr Carovius all about her affair with Benjamin Dorn, evidently
believing that he was all fire and flame to know how she
was getting along and what she had <i>in petto</i>. Herr Carovius had
long since grown sick and tired of her, though he did not show
her the door. He had reached the point where he heaved a sigh
of relief when he heard a human voice, where he began to dread
the stillness that ruled supreme within his four walls. No one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>came to see him, no one spoke to him, and he in turn no longer
had the courage to speak to any one. His arrogance of former
days had died a difficult death, and now he saw no way of making
friends. If he went to the caf&eacute;, there was no one there whom
he knew. The brethren of the Vale of Tears had been scattered
to the four corners of the earth; a new generation was having its
fling; new customs were being introduced, new topics discussed,
and he was old.</p>

<p>He found it hard to get along without Dorothea. He counted
the days, waiting for her to return. He never opened the piano,
because all music, and especially the music he loved, caused a
melancholy depression to arise that filled the room with miasma.</p>

<p>The Nero of our day was suffering from C&aelig;sar sadness. The
private citizen had sunk to the very bottom of the ditch which
he himself had dug with the idea of burying all that was new
and joyful, and all winged creatures in it.</p>

<p>The worst of it all was that he had nothing to do, and no
brain racking could devise a position he could fill. The world
went on its way, progress was made, and, strangely enough, it was
made without his criticism, his adulation, his opinions, or his crepe-hanging.</p>

<p>Philippina was annoyed at the grudging squints cast at her by
the old stay-at-home; her visits became rarer and rarer. She did
not feel like opening her heart to Frau Hadebusch, for she did
not appeal to her as a disinterested party. This completed her list
of friends; she was obliged to restrain her impatience and excitement.</p>

<p>It was Christmas. On Christmas Eve they had bought a tree
for Agnes, trimmed it, and lighted it with candles. Agnes&#8217;s
Christmas gifts were placed under the tree: a big piece of ginger-bread,
a basket with apples and nuts, and a cheap doll. For Old
Jordan she had bought a pair of boots which he badly needed. He
had been going around on his uppers since autumn.</p>

<p>Jordan was sitting by the door holding his boots on his knees.
Agnes looked at the doll with unhappy eyes; she did not dare
touch it. After gazing for a while into the light of the fluttering
candles, Jordan said: &#8220;I thank you, Philippina, I thank you. You
are a real benefactress. I also thank you for remembering the
child. It is a paltry makeshift you have bought there at the
bazaar, but any one who gives gifts to children deserves the reward
of Heaven, and in such giving we do not weigh the value or count
the cost.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t whine all the time so!&#8221; shrieked Philippina. She was
chewing her finger nails, hardly able to conceal her embarrassment.
Frau Hadebusch had told her that Benjamin Dorn was coming
around that evening to make a formal proposal of marriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just wait, Agnes, just wait!&#8221; continued old Jordan, &#8220;you&#8217;ll
soon get to see a wonder of a doll. A few short years, and the
world will be astonished. You are going to be the first to see it
when it is finished. You&#8217;ll be the first, little Agnes, just wait.
What have we got to eat on this holy evening?&#8221; asked Jordan,
turning with fear and trembling to Philippina.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cold hash and broiled meal-beetles,&#8221; said Philippina scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;And ... and ... no letter from Daniel?&#8221; he asked in a
sad voice, &#8220;nothing, nothing at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina shrugged her shoulders. The old man got up and
tottered to his room.</p>

<p>A little later Philippina heard some one stumbling around in
the hall, and then the bell rang. &#8220;Open the door,&#8221; she said to
Agnes, who did as she was told and returned with Benjamin Dorn.
The Methodist wore a black suit, and in his hand he had a black
felt hat that was as flat as a pancake. He bowed to Philippina,
and asked if he was disturbing any one. Philippina pushed a chair
over to him. He sat down quite circumstantially, and laughed a
hollow laugh. As Philippina was as silent as the tomb and looked
at him so tensely, he began to speak.</p>

<p>First he expatiated on the general advantages of a married life,
and then remarked that what he personally wished first of all was
to be able to take a good, true woman into his own life as his
wife. He said that he had gone through a long struggle over the
matter, but God had finally shown him the light and pointed the
way. He no longer hesitated, after this illumination from above,
to offer Fr&auml;ulein Schimmelweis his heart and his hand forever
and a day, insist though he must that she give the matter due
consideration, in the proper Christian spirit, before taking the
all-important step.</p>

<p>Philippina was restless; she rocked back and forth, first on one
foot and then on another&mdash;and then burst out laughing. She
bent over and laughed violently. &#8220;No, you poor simpleton, what
you want is my money, hey? Be honest! Out with it! You
want my money, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her anger grew as Benjamin Dorn sat and looked on, his asinine
embarrassment increasing with each second of silence. &#8220;Listen!
You&#8217;d like to git your fingers on it, wouldn&#8217;t you? Money&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>would taste good, wouldn&#8217;t it? You think I&#8217;m crazy? Scrape a
few coppers together and lose my mind and marry some poor fool,
and let him loaf around and live on me. Nothing doin&#8217;! They
ain&#8217;t no man livin&#8217; what can catch Philippina Schimmelweis so
easy as all that. She knows a thing or two about men, she does.
D&#8217;ye hear me! Get out!&#8221; She sawed the air with her arms like
a mad woman, and showed him the door.</p>

<p>Benjamin Dorn rose to his feet, stuttered something unintelligible,
moved backwards toward the door, reached it, and left the
place with such pronounced speed that Philippina once again broke
out in a shrill, piercing laughter. &#8220;Come here, Agnes,&#8221; she said,
sat down on the step in the corner, and took the child on her lap.</p>

<p>She was silent for a long while; the child was afraid to speak.
Both looked at the lights on the Christmas tree. &#8220;Let us sing
something,&#8221; said Philippina. She began with a hoarse, bass voice,
&#8220;Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht,&#8221; and Agnes joined in with her high,
spiritless notes.</p>

<p>Another pause followed after they had finished singing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my father?&#8221; asked Agnes suddenly, without looking
at Philippina. It sounded as if she had waited for years for an
opportunity to ask this question.</p>

<p>Philippina&#8217;s face turned ashen pale; she gritted her teeth.
&#8220;Your father, he&#8217;s loafing around somewhere in the country,&#8221;
replied Philippina, and blew out one of the candles that had
burned down and was ready to set the twig on fire. &#8220;He&#8217;s done
with women, it seems, but you can&#8217;t tell. He strums the music
box and smears good white paper full of crow-feet and pot-hooks.
A person can rot, and little does he worry.&#8221; Whereat she set the
child on the floor, hastened over to the window, opened it, and
put her head out as if she were on the point of choking with
the heat.</p>

<p>She leaned out over the snow-covered window sill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting cold,&#8221; said Agnes; but Philippina never heard her.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Daniel wrote to Eberhard and Sylvia asking them if he might
visit them. He thought: &#8220;There are friends; perhaps I need
friends again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He received a note in a strange, secretarial hand informing him
that the Baroness was indeed very sorry but she could not receive
him at Siegmundshof: she was in child-bed. She sent her best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>greetings, and told him that the newest born was getting along
splendidly, as well as his brother who was now three years old.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everywhere I turn, children are growing up,&#8221; thought Daniel,
and packed his trunk and started south as slowly as he could go,
so slowly indeed that it seemed as if he were approaching a goal
he was afraid to reach and yet had to.</p>

<p>He arrived in Nuremberg one evening in April. As he entered
the room, Philippina struck her hands together with a loud bang,
and stood as if rooted to the floor.</p>

<p>Agnes looked at her father shyly. She had grown slim and
tall far beyond her age.</p>

<p>Old Jordan came down. &#8220;You don&#8217;t look well, Daniel,&#8221; he said,
and seemed never to let go of his hand. &#8220;Let us hope that you
are going to stay home now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Daniel, staring absent-mindedly around
the walls. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the third day he was seized with a quite unusual sense of
fear and anxiety. He felt that he had made a mistake; that he
had lost his way; that something was driving him to another place.
He went into the kitchen. Philippina was cooking potato noodles
in lard; they smelt good.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to Eschenbach,&#8221; he said, to his own astonishment,
for the decision to do so had come with the assertion.</p>

<p>Philippina jerked the pan from the stove; the flames leaped up.
&#8220;You can go to Hell, so far as I&#8217;m concerned,&#8221; she said in a furious
rage. With the light from the fire flaring up through the open
top of the stove and reflected in her face, she looked like a veritable
witch.</p>

<p>Daniel gazed at her questioningly. &#8220;What is the matter with
Agnes?&#8221; he asked after a while. &#8220;The child seems to try to
avoid me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find out what&#8217;s the matter with her,&#8221; said Philippina
spitefully, and placed the pan on the stove again. &#8220;She don&#8217;t
swallow people whole.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel left the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is going over to see his bastard, the damned scoundrel,&#8221;
murmured Philippina. She crouched down on the kitchen stool,
and gazed into space.</p>

<p>The potato noodles burned up.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p><h3>IX</h3>

<p>Daniel entered his mother&#8217;s little house in Eschenbach late at
night. As soon as he saw her, he knew that some misfortune had
taken place.</p>

<p>Eva was gone. She had disappeared one evening four weeks
ago. A troupe of rope dancers had given an exhibition in the
city, and it was generally suspected that they had abducted the
child. The people of Eschenbach were still convinced of their
suspicion after the police had rounded up the dancers without
finding a trace of the child.</p>

<p>A general alarm had been sent out, and investigations were being
made even at the time of Daniel&#8217;s arrival. But they were in vain;
it was impossible to find the slightest clue. To the authorities,
indeed to every one, the case was a hopeless riddle.</p>

<p>They made a thorough search of the forests; the canals were
drained; vagabonds were cross-questioned. It was all in vain; Eva
had apparently been spirited away in some mysterious fashion.
Then the Mayor received an anonymous letter that read as follows:
&#8220;The child you are looking for is in safe keeping. She was not
forced to do what she has done; of her own free will and out of
love for her art she went off with the people with whom she is
at present. She sends her grandmother the tenderest of greetings,
and hopes to see her some time again, after she has attained to
what she now has in mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this Eva had added in a handwriting which Marian Nothafft
could be reasonably certain was her own: &#8220;This is true. Good-bye,
grandmother!&#8221;</p>

<p>The people who mourned with Marian the loss of the child
were convinced that if Eva had really written these words herself,
she had been forced to do it by the kidnappers.</p>

<p>The letter bore the postmark of a city in the Rhenish Palatinate.
A telegram brought the reply that a company of jugglers had
been there a short while ago, but that they had already gone. It
was impossible to say in what direction, but it was most likely
that they had gone to France.</p>

<p>Marian was completely broken up. She no longer had any
interest in life. She did not even manifest joy or pleasure at
seeing Daniel.</p>

<p>Daniel in turn felt that the brightest star had fallen from his
heaven. As soon as he had really grasped the full meaning of the
tragedy, he went quietly into the attic room, threw himself across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>the bed of his lost daughter, and wept. &#8220;Man, man, are you
weeping at last?&#8221; a voice seemed to call out to him.</p>

<p>Of evenings he would sit with his mother, and they would both
brood over the loss. Once Marian began to speak; she talked
of Eva. She had always been made uneasy by the child&#8217;s love for
mimicry and shows of any kind. Long ago, she said, when Eva was
only eight years old, a company of comedians had come to the
village, and Eva had taken a passionate interest in them. She
would run around the tent in which they played, from early in
the morning until late in the evening. She had made the acquaintance
of some of them at the time, and one of them took her along
to a performance. Whenever the circus came to town, it was impossible
to keep her in the house. &#8220;At times I thought to myself,
there must be gipsy blood in her veins,&#8221; said Marian sadly, &#8220;but
she was such a good and obedient child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another time she told the following story. One Sunday in
spring she took a walk with Eva. It had grown late, night had
come on, and on the return journey they had to go through the
forest. Marian became tired, and sat down on the stump of a
tree to rest. The moon was shining, and there was a clearing in
the forest where they had stopped. All of a sudden Eva sprang up
and began to dance. &#8220;It was marvellous the way she danced,&#8221; said
Marian, at the close of her story. &#8220;The girl&#8217;s slender, delicate
little figure seemed to glide around on the moss in the moonlight
of its own accord. It was marvellous, but my heart grew heavy,
and I thought to myself at the time, she is not going to be with me
much longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel was silent. &#8220;Oh, enchanting and enchanted creature!&#8221;
he thought, &#8220;heredity and destiny!&#8221;</p>

<p>He remained with his mother for three weeks. Then he began
to feel cramped and uneasy. The house and the town both seemed
so small to him. He left and went to Vienna, where the custodian
of the Imperial Institute had some invaluable manuscripts for
him.</p>

<p>Six weeks later he received a letter that had followed him all
over south Europe informing him of the death of his mother.
The school teacher at Eschenbach had written the letter, saying,
among other things, that the aged woman had died during the
night, suddenly and peacefully.</p>

<p>A second letter followed, requesting him to state what disposition
should be made of his mother&#8217;s property. He was asked
whether the house was to be put on the market. A neighbour, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>green-grocer, had expressed his willingness to look after Daniel&#8217;s
interests.</p>

<p>Daniel wrote in reply that they should do whatever seemed best.
There was a heavy mortgage on the house, and the amount that
could reasonably be asked for it was not large.</p>

<p>He retired to a desolate and waste place.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>While living in little towns and villages on the Danube, Daniel
completed the third movement of the Promethean symphony.
When he awoke as if from a delirious fever, it was autumn.</p>

<p>One morning in October he heard a saint playing the organ. It
was in the Church of St. Florian near Enns. The great artist
had lived in former years in the monastery, and now had the habit
of coming back once in a while to hold communion with his God.
In his rapture, Daniel felt as if his own crowned brother were at
the organ. He sat in a corner and listened, meekly and with overwhelming
delight. Then when a man passed by him, a stooped,
haggard, odd-looking old fellow with a wrinkled face and dressed
in shabby clothes, he was terror-stricken at the reality, the corporeality
of genius: he wondered whether he himself were not a
ghost.</p>

<p>The Swallow wrote: &#8220;There is only one who can redeem us:
the musician. The day of founders of religion, builders of states,
military heroes, and discoverers is gone. The poets have only
words, and our ears have grown tired of words, words, words. They
have only pictures and figures, and our eyes are tired beholding.
The soul&#8217;s last consolation is to be found in music; of this I am
certain. If there is any one thing that can make restitution for
the lost illusions of religious faith, provide us with wings, transform
us, and save us from the abyss to which we are rushing with
savage senses, it is music. Where are you, O redeemer? You are
wandering about over the earth, the poorest, the most abandoned,
the guiltiest of men. When are you going to pay your debts,
Daniel Nothafft?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel spent seven months in Ravenna, Ferrara, Florence, and
Pisa. He was looking for some manuscripts by Frescobaldi,
Borghesi, and Ercole Pasquini. Having found the most important
ones he could regard his collection as complete.</p>

<p>Men seemed to him like puppets, landscapes like paintings on
glass. He longed for forests; his dreams became disordered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p><p>From Genoa he wandered on foot through Lombardy and across
the Alps. He slept on hard beds in order to keep his hot blood
in check, and lived on bread and cheese. His attacks of weakness,
sometimes of complete exhaustion, did not worry him at first; he
paid no attention to them. But in Augsburg he swooned, falling
headlong on the street. He was taken to a hospital, where he lay
for three months with typhus. From his window he could see
the tall chimneys of factories and an endless procession of wandering
clouds. It had become winter; the ground was covered with
snow.</p>

<p>Two years after his last visit he again entered the house on
&AElig;gydius Place. When Philippina saw him, so pale and emaciated,
she uttered a cry of horror.</p>

<p>Agnes had grown still taller, thinner, and more serious. At
times when she looked at her father he felt like crying out to
her in anger: &#8220;What do you mean by your everlasting questions?&#8221;
But he never said a word of this kind to her.</p>

<p>When Philippina saw that Daniel had returned as lonesome and
uncommunicative as he was when he went away, she took it upon
herself to display a great deal of gentleness, kindness, sympathy
in his presence. Old Jordan was living the same life he had been
living for years. Everything in fact was just the same; it seemed
that the household was run according to a prescribed routine. It
seemed as if Daniel had been away, not six years, but six days.</p>

<p>He did not feel strong yet, but he worked day and night. The
fourth movement of the symphony gave promise of being a miracle
of polyphony. Daniel felt primeval existence, the original of all
longing, the basic grief of the world urging and pulsing in him,
and this he was translating into the symphony. The eternal
wanderer had arrived at the gates of Heaven and was not admitted.
Supernal harmonies had borne him aloft. Muffled drum beats
symbolised his beseeching raps on closed doors. Within resounded
the terrible &#8220;no&#8221; of the trumpets. The pleading of the violins
was in vain; in vain the intercession of the one angel standing at
the right, leaning on a harp without strings; in vain the melodious
chants of the other angel at the left, crowned with flowers and
all together lovely; in vain the elfin chorus of the upper voices,
in vain the foaming lament of the voices below. No path here
for him, and no space!</p>

<p>One evening Daniel noticed a strange girl at his window. She
was beautiful. Struck by her charms, he got up to go to her. She
had vanished. It was an hallucination. He became afraid of himself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>left the house, and wandered through the streets as in days
of long ago.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>It was Carnival Week, and the people had resumed their wonted
gaiety. Masked boys and girls paraded the streets, making merry
wherever they went.</p>

<p>As Daniel was passing through The F&uuml;ll he was startled: the
windows in the Benda house were lighted. He suddenly recalled
that Herr Seelenfromm had told him that Frau Benda had returned
from Worms some time ago, and was living with her niece; she
had become totally blind.</p>

<p>He went up the steps and rang the bell. A grey-haired, distressed-looking
woman came to the door. He thought she must
be the niece. He told her his name; she said she had heard
of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You probably know that Friedrich has disappeared,&#8221; she said
in a sleepy, sing-song voice. &#8220;It is eight years since we have heard
from him. The last letter was from the interior of Africa. We
have given up all hope. Not even the newspapers say anything
more about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have read nothing about it,&#8221; murmured Daniel. &#8220;But
Friedrich cannot be dead,&#8221; he continued, shaking his head, &#8220;I will
never believe it, never.&#8221; Partly in distraction and partly in anxiety,
he riveted his eyes on the woman, who stared at his glasses as if held
by a charm.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have done everything that was humanly possible,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;We have written to the consulates, we have inquired of the military
outposts and missionary stations, and all to no purpose.&#8221; After
a pause she said with a little more vivacity: &#8220;You do not wish me
to ask you in, I hope. It is so painful to my aunt to hear a strange
voice, and I cannot think of letting you talk to her. If I did, it
would merely open her old wounds, and she has a hard enough
time of it as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel nodded and went on his way. A coarse laugh could be
heard down in the entrance hall; it was painfully out of harmony
with the depressed atmosphere of the Benda apartment. He felt
his heart grow faint; he felt a burning desire for something,
though he was unable to say precisely what, something sweet and
radiant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p><p>On the last landing he stopped, and looked with utter amazement
into the hall below.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius was dancing like a Merry-Andrew around the
door of his residence. He had a crown of silver paper on his head,
and was trying to ward off the importunate advances of a young
girl. His smiles were tender but senile. The girl wore a carnival
costume. Her dark blue velvet dress, covered with threads of
silver, made her robust figure look slenderer than it actually was.
A black veil-like cloth hung from her shoulders to the ground, and
then draped along behind her for about three paces. It was sprinkled
with glittering tinsel. In her hand she held a hideous wax
mask of the face of an old sot with a red nose. She was trying to
fit the mask to Herr Carovius&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>She was working hard to make him yield; she said she was not
going to leave until she had put the mask on his face. Herr
Carovius shook the door, which in the meantime had closed,
fumbled about in his pockets for the key, but the girl gave him
no peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now, Teddy,&#8221; she kept crying, &#8220;come, Uncle, don&#8217;t be
such an old bore.&#8221; She kept getting closer and closer to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wait, I&#8217;ll show you how to make a fool of respectable
people,&#8221; croaked Herr Carovius in well-meaning anger. He
resembled an old dog, hopping about and getting ready to make
the plunge when his master throws his walking stick into the
water. In his zeal, however, to prevent the girl from offending
his dignity, he had forgotten the paper crown on his head. It
wabbled and shook so when he hopped around, that the girl nearly
split her sides laughing.</p>

<p>A maid came in just then with an apronful of snow. The girl
with the sweeping train ran up to her, got some of the snow, and
threatened to pelt Herr Carovius with it. He begged for mercy;
and rather than undergo a bombardment with this cold stuff, he
ceased offering resistance, whereupon the girl walked up to him
and placed the mask on his face. Then, exhausted from laughter,
she laid her head on his shoulder. The maid&mdash;it was D&ouml;derlein&#8217;s
maid&mdash;was delighted at the comedy, and made a noise that resembled
the cackling of a hen.</p>

<p>The scene was dimly lighted by a lamp attached to the adjacent
wall, and had on this account, quite apart from the sight of Herr
Carovius with the paper crown and the toper&#8217;s mask, something
fantastic about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p><p>Daniel did not know that the girl was Dorothea D&ouml;derlein,
though he half suspected as much. But whoever she was, he was
impressed by her jollity, her actual lust for laughter, her complete
lack of restraint. He had never known that sort of mirthful
hilarity; and if he had known it, he could not recall it. Her
youthful features, her bright eyes, her white teeth, her agile gestures
filled him with deferential respect; his eyes swam with
emotion. He felt so old, so foreign; he felt that where he was
the sun was not shining, the flowers were not budding. He felt
that life had appeared to him all of a sudden and quite unexpectedly
in a new, kindly, bewitching light.</p>

<p>He came slowly down the steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible!&#8221; cried Herr Carovius, tearing the mask from his
face. &#8220;Can I trust my own eyes? It is our <i>maestro</i>! Or is it
his ghost?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is both he and his ghost,&#8221; replied Daniel drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no place for ghosts,&#8221; cried Dorothea, and threw a
snow ball, hitting him square on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Daniel looked at her; she blushed, and looked at Herr Carovius
questioningly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know our Daniel Nothafft, you little
ignoramus?&#8221; said Herr Carovius. &#8220;You know nothing of our
coryph&aelig;us? Hail to the Master! Welcome home! He is here,
covered with fame!&#8221;</p>

<p>At any other time Herr Carovius&#8217;s biliary sarcasm would have
aroused Daniel&#8217;s whole stock-in-trade of aversion and indignation.
To-day he was unimpressed by it. &#8220;How young she is,&#8221; he thought,
as he feasted his eyes on the embarrassed, laughing Dorothea, &#8220;how
gloriously young!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea was angry because she did not have on the red dress
she had had made in Munich.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dorothea!&#8221; called a strong voice from the first floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s father!&#8221; whispered Dorothea. She was frightened.
She ran up the steps on her tiptoes, dragging her long veil after
her. The maid followed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;A devil, a regular little devil, <i>Maestro</i>,&#8221; said Herr Carovius
turning to Daniel. &#8220;You must come in some time and hear how
she can draw the bow. She&#8217;s a regular little devil, I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel bade Herr Carovius adieu, and went walking down the
street with bowed head.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p><h3>XII</h3>

<p>In the province, Dorothea D&ouml;derlein, fresh from the Bavarian
capital, was a phenomenon that attracted general attention. Her
conduct seemed, to be sure, a bit liberal, but then she was an
artist, and her name appeared in the newspapers every now and
then, so it was only natural to make allowances for her. When
she gave her first concert, Adler Hall was almost completely
sold out.</p>

<p>The musical critic of the <i>Herold</i> was captivated by her capricious
playing. He called her an extraordinary talent, and predicted a
brilliant future for her. Andreas D&ouml;derlein accepted the congratulations
in the spirit of a seasoned patron of the arts; Herr
Carovius was in the seventh heaven of joy. He who had formerly
been so captious never uttered a critical word. He had taken to
worshipping the Dorothea cult, and this had made him quite
indiscriminating.</p>

<p>At first Dorothea never suffered from want of invitations to all
manner of clubs, dances, and family gatherings. She was much
adored by the young men, so much so that other daughters of the
city of matrimonial age could not sleep from envy. In a short
while, however, the youth of more sterling character, warned
while there was yet time by their mothers, sisters, cousins, and
aunts, withdrew in fear.</p>

<p>Dorothea reaped the disapproval of her acquaintances by walking
with her admirers in public, unchaperoned. Moreover she
could frequently be seen in the company of officers in the Eisenbeiss
pastry shop, drinking chocolate and having a good time generally.
Once she had been seen in the society of a big blonde Swede from
Schuckert&#8217;s factory coming out of the Music Hall. The rumour
was spread that she had lived an irregular life in Munich, had
gadded about the streets at night, contracted a number of bad
debts, and flirted with all kinds of men.</p>

<p>Yet there were a few serious wooers who, duped by Andreas
D&ouml;derlein&#8217;s diplomacy, fell into the habit of coming around on
Sunday evenings and taking dinner with father and daughter.
Dorothea, however, always managed to play off one against the
other; and as they were all serious and provincial, they did not
know precisely what to make of it. In order to instil patience
into them, D&ouml;derlein took to delivering them lectures on the
intricate complications of the artistic temperament, or he made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>mysterious allusions to the handsome legacy to which Dorothea
would one day fall heir.</p>

<p>It was this very fact, however, that made him exercise caution
with regard to Dorothea. Knowing her spirit of defiance, and
appreciating her youthful lack of judgment, he was afraid she
might make some <i>faux pas</i> that would offend that old fool of a
Carovius. He was already giving her a little spending money,
and the D&ouml;derleins found this a highly advantageous arrangement.</p>

<p>The state of D&ouml;derlein&#8217;s own finances was hopeless. It was
with the greatest difficulty that he kept up the appearance of a
well-to-do man. The chief cause of his pecuniary embarrassment
was his relation of long standing with a woman by whom he
had had three children. To support this second family, of whose
existence not a soul in his immediate surroundings knew a thing,
burdened him with a care that made it hard for him to preserve
his cheerful, Jove-like disposition.</p>

<p>He had been leading a double life for fourteen years. His
regular visits to the woman he loved&mdash;she lived very quietly out
in the remote suburbs of the city&mdash;had to be made without attracting
attention. To conceal his connection with her from the
vigilant eyes of his fellow citizens made constant dissimulation,
discretion, and shrewdness a necessary part of his character. But
to practise these traits year in and year out and suffer at the same
time from economic pressure filled him with suppressed anger
and fear.</p>

<p>He was afraid of Dorothea. There were moments when he
would have liked to maul her; and yet he saw himself obliged
to hold her in check with kind words. He could not see through
her. But she was always around, always adding to his troubles with
her plans, wishes, engagements and intrigues. He thought he had
her under control, only to discover that she was a tyrant, lording
it over him. Now she would burst out crying because of some
bagatelle, now she was laughing as though nothing had ever happened.
The roses her serious and moneyed admirers brought her
she picked to pieces in their very presence, and threw the pieces
in the waste-paper basket. D&ouml;derlein would lecture her in the
kindest and most intelligent way on good morals and gentle manners,
and she would listen as though she were a saint. Five minutes
later she would be hanging out of the window, flirting with the
barber&#8217;s boy across the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an unfortunate father,&#8221; said Andreas D&ouml;derlein to himself,
when, apart from all his other multifarious worries, he began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>to be sceptical about Dorothea&#8217;s artistic ability. Shortly after her
success in Nuremberg, she gave a concert in Frankfort, but everything
was pretty quiet. Then she toured the small towns of central
Germany, and was received everywhere with the greatest
enthusiasm. But what of it? How much critical acumen is to be
found in such places?</p>

<p>One evening she was at the home of a certain Frau Feistelmann,
a woman whose past had some connection with nearly every scandal
of the city. While there she met an actor by the name of
Edmund Hahn. Herr Hahn had soft, blonde hair and a pale,
bloated face. He was rather tall and had long legs. Dorothea
raved about long legs. There was a thoroughly sensual atmosphere
about the man; he devoured Dorothea with his impudent eyes.
His build, his bearing, his half blas&eacute;, half emphatic way of speaking
made an impression on Dorothea. He sat next to her at the
table, and began to rub his feet against hers. Finally he succeeded
in getting his left foot on her slipper. She tried to pull her foot
back, but the more she tried the harder he bore down on it. She
looked at him in amazement; but he smiled cynically, and in a few
minutes they were desperately intimate. After dinner they withdrew
to a hidden corner, and you could hear Dorothea giggling.</p>

<p>They arranged to meet each other on a certain street corner
in the dark. He sent her free tickets to &#8220;Maria Stuart&#8221; and &#8220;Die
R&auml;uber.&#8221; He played the r&ocirc;les of Mortimer and Kosinsky; he
roared till you thought the roof would fall in. He introduced
Dorothea to a number of his friends, and these brought their girl
friends along, and they all sat in the Nassau Cellar till break of
day. Among them was a certain Samuelsky, an employ&eacute; of the
Reutlinger Bank. He had the manners of a man about town,
drank champagne, and went mad over Dorothea. She submitted
to his attention, welcomed it in fact, and accepted presents from
him, though, as it seemed, not until she had received the permission
from Edmund Hahn. Once he tried to kiss her: she gave him a
ringing box on the ears. He wiped his cheek, and called her a
siren.</p>

<p>She liked the expression. At times she would stand before the
mirror, and whisper: &#8220;Siren.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Andreas D&ouml;derlein heard of what was going on, he had
an attack of mad rage. &#8220;I will put you out of the house,&#8221; he
exclaimed, &#8220;I will beat you until you are a helpless, despicable
cripple.&#8221; But in his eyes there was again the trace of that suppressed
fear that gave the lie to his seeming berserker rage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;An artist does not need to adapt her morals to the code of the
Philistine,&#8221; remarked Dorothea, with complete imperturbability.
&#8220;Those are all nice people with whom I am going. Every one
of them is a gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>A gentleman: that was an argument against which it was futile
to enter a caveat. In her eyes that man was a gentleman who ran
risks, impressed waiters and coachmen, and wore creased trousers.
&#8220;No one dares come too close to me,&#8221; she said with much pride.
That was the truth; no one had thus far awakened her deepest
curiosity, and she had determined to put a high price on herself.
Edmund Hahn was the only one who had any influence on her;
and this was true of him because he was absolutely devoid of feeling,
and had a type of shamelessness that completely disarmed and
terrified her.</p>

<p>Andreas D&ouml;derlein had to let her have her way. If he had
any consolation at all, it lay in the belief on his part that a real
D&ouml;derlein would never voluntarily come to grief. If Dorothea
was a genuine D&ouml;derlein, she would march straight to her objective,
and take by storm the good and useful things of life. If she
failed, it would be proof that there was a flaw somewhere in her
birth. This was his logic; and having applied it, theoretically, he
enshrouded himself in the clouds of his Olympus.</p>

<p>Dorothea gave her uncle Carovius, however, detailed accounts
of how she was making her suitors, young and old, walk the war-path.
They all had to do it, the actor and the banker, the candle
manufacturer and the engineer. She said she was leading the
whole pack of them around by the nose. Herr Carovius&#8217;s face
beamed with joy when he heard her say this. He called her his
little jackanapes, and said she was the fortune of his old age. To
himself he said that she was a genuine Carovius destined to great
deeds.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to get married,&#8221; he said with the urge of a
zealot of old, and rubbed his hands. &#8220;Oh, of course, if a Count
comes along with a few millions and a castle in the background,
why, you might think it over. But just let some greasy comedian
get it into his head that he is going to steal you away from me!
Or let some wabbly-hipped office-boy imagine for a minute that
he is going to drag you into his circle along with his other unwashed
acquaintances! If this ever happens, Dorothea, give it to &#8217;em hot
and heavy! Show the wanton satyrs what kind of blood you have
in you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Uncle,&#8221; said Dorothea, &#8220;I know you mean well by me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>You are the only one who does. But if I were only not so poor!
Look at me! Look at this dress I have on! It&#8217;s a sight!&#8221; And
she put her head in her uplifted arm and sobbed.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius pulled at his moustaches, moved his eyebrows up
and down, went to his writing desk, opened his strong box, took
out a hundred-mark bill, and gave it to her with turned head, as
if he were afraid of the wrath of the protecting spirit of the
money chest.</p>

<p>This was the state of affairs when Daniel met the youthful
Dorothea in Herr Carovius&#8217;s home, and went away with an unforgettable,
unextinguishable picture of her in his soul.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Daniel&#8217;s approaching fortieth birthday seemed like a sombre
portal leading to the realm of spent ambition. &#8220;Seize what
remains to be seized,&#8221; a voice within him cried. &#8220;Grass is growing
on the graves.&#8221;</p>

<p>His senses were at war with his intellect and his heart. He had
never looked on women as he was looking on them now.</p>

<p>One day he went out to Siegmundshof. Eberhard was not at
home. Sylvia&#8217;s face showed traces of subdued sadness. She had
three children, each one more beautiful than the other, but when
her eyes rested on them her heart was filled with grief. Women
whose married life is unhappy have dull, lifeless features; their
hands are transparent and yellow.</p>

<p>Daniel took leave more quickly than he had wished or intended.
He felt an egoistic aversion to the joyless sons of man.</p>

<p>He went to see Herr Carovius. The laughing one whom he
sought was not at home.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius looked at him at times distrustfully. The face
of his former foe set him to thinking. It was furrowed like a
field under cultivation and burnt like a hearthstone. It was the
face of a criminal, crabbed, enervated, tense, and breathed upon,
it seemed, by threatening clouds. Herr Carovius was a connoisseur
of faces.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the discomfort of fatuous conversation, Daniel
played a number of old motetts for Herr Carovius. Herr Carovius
was so pleased that he ran into his pantry, and got a half dozen
Boxdorf apples and put them in Daniel&#8217;s pockets. He bought
these apples every autumn by the peck, and cherished them as so
many priceless treasures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;At the sound of such music it would not be difficult to become
a real Christian,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is spring in them,&#8221; said Daniel, &#8220;they are art that is
as innocent as new seed in the soil. But your piano needs
tuning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Symbolic, symbolic, my dear friend,&#8221; cried Herr Carovius, and
puffed out his cheeks. &#8220;But you come back another time, and you
will find it in the pink of condition. Come frequently, please.
You will reap the reward of Heaven if you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herr Carovius begging for company; it was touching. Daniel
promised to bring some of the manuscripts he had been collecting
along with him. When he returned a few days later, Dorothea
was there; and from then on she was always there. His visits
became longer and longer. When Herr Carovius noticed that
Dorothea was coming to see him more frequently now, he moved
heaven and earth to persuade Daniel to come more frequently.
He rained reproach and abuse on him if he failed to come; if he
was late, he greeted him with a sour face and put indiscreet questions
to him. When he was alone of an afternoon, time stood
still. He was like a drinker tantalised by seeing his accustomed
portion of brandy on the table but just beyond his reach. The
company of these two people, Daniel and Dorothea, had become as
indispensable to his happiness as in former years the reading of
the newspapers, the brethren of the Vale of Tears, the troubles
of Eberhard and the funerals were indispensable if he were to feel
at ease. It is the way of the small citizen: each of his customs
becomes a passion.</p>

<p>When Daniel played the old chorals, Dorothea listened quietly,
though it could not be said that she was perfect at concealing
her tedium.</p>

<p>One time they began talking about Dorothea&#8217;s violin playing.
Herr Carovius asked her to play something. She declined without
the slightest display of affectation. Daniel said nothing to encourage
her; he found that this modesty was becoming to her; he
believed that he detected wisdom and resignation in her behaviour;
he smiled at her graciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us a story, Daniel,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that would be better.&#8221;
It eventually came out that that was what she had wanted all along.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a poor raconteur,&#8221; said Daniel. &#8220;I have a thick tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>She begged him, however, with stammering words and beseeching
gestures. Herr Carovius tittered. Daniel took off his glasses,
polished them, and looked at the young girl with squinting eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>It seemed as if the glasses had made it difficult for him to see
Dorothea distinctly, or as if he preferred to see her indistinctly.
&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know what I could tell in the way of a story,&#8221; he
replied, shaking his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us everything, anything,&#8221; cried Dorothea, seized with a
veritable fit of eagerness to hear him talk. She stretched out her
hands toward him: that seemed to him to be so like a child. He
had never told stories to a child; he had never in truth told stories
to any one. Gertrude and Eleanore had, to be sure, forced a confession
or a complaint from him at times, but that was all, and all
that was necessary or appropriate.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was drawn on by the word in which his fate would
be quietly reflected; by the fiery young eye in the brilliancy of
which the complex became simple, the dark bright; by the wicked
old man to whom the whole world, as seen from his mire, had
become a poisonous food.</p>

<p>And with his brittle, staccato voice he told of the countries
through which he had journeyed; of the sea and the cities by the
sea; of the Alps and the Alpine lakes; of cathedrals, palaces, and
marvellous monasteries; of the queer people he had met, of his
work and his loneliness. It was all incoherent, arid, and loveless.
Though sorely tempted, he desisted from mentioning things that
came close to his soul; things that moved his heart, fired his brain.
When he told of the Jewess, the Swallow, he did not even finish
the sentence. He made a long pause, and then shifted to the
account of his visit to Eschenbach. Here he stopped again before
he was through.</p>

<p>But Dorothea began to ask questions. It was all too general and
therefore unsatisfactory. &#8220;What was there in Eschenbach? Why
did you go there?&#8221; she asked boldly.</p>

<p>He was in error concerning the hot desire that burned in her
eyes to know about Eschenbach. Her question made him feel
good; he believed that he was on the scent of warm-heartedness;
he thought he had found a soul that was eager to help through
knowledge. He was seized with the desire of the mature man to
fashion an untouched soul in harmony with the picture of his
dreams. &#8220;My mother used to live there,&#8221; he replied hesitatingly,
&#8220;she has died.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and?&#8221; breathed Dorothea. She saw that that was not all.</p>

<p>He felt that this uncompromising reticence was not right; he
felt a sense of guilt. With still greater hesitation&mdash;and immediate
repentance&mdash;he added: &#8220;A child of mine also lived there; she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>eleven years old. She has disappeared; no one knows where she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea folded her hands, &#8220;A child? And disappeared? Simply
vanished?&#8221; she whispered excitedly.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius looked like a man sitting on a hot iron. &#8220;Eleven
years old?&#8221; he asked, hungry for sensation, &#8220;why&mdash;that was, then&mdash;before
the time&nbsp;...&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was before the time,&#8221; said Daniel gloomily and by way
of confirmation. He had betrayed himself, and was angry at himself
for having done so. He became silent; it was impossible to
get him to say another word.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius noticed how Dorothea hung on Daniel&#8217;s eyes.
A tormenting suspicion arose in him. &#8220;Yesterday out on St.
Joseph&#8217;s Place, I was talking with one of your admirers, the fellow
who shatters the wings of the stage with his ranting,&#8221; he began
with malice aforethought. &#8220;The blade had the nerve to say to me:
&#8216;You&#8217;d better hurry up and get Dorothea D&ouml;derlein a husband, or
people will talk their tongues loose in their throats.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not true,&#8221; cried Dorothea indignantly, blushing to the
roots of her hair. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t say that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herr Carovius laughed malevolently. &#8220;Well, if it is not true,
it is pretty well put together,&#8221; he said with his usual bleat.</p>

<p>When Daniel left, Dorothea accompanied him to the outside
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity,&#8221; murmured Daniel, &#8220;a pity!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why a pity? I am free. There isn&#8217;t a soul in the world
who has any claim on me.&#8221; She looked at him with the courage
of a real woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are remarks that are just like grease spots,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, who can keep from the dirt these days?&#8221; she asked, almost
wild with excitement.</p>

<p>Daniel let his eyes rest on her as though she were some material
object. He said slowly and seriously: &#8220;Keep your hands and your
eyes off of me, Dorothea. I will bring you no happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lips opened, thirsty. &#8220;I should like to take a walk with you
some time,&#8221; she whispered, and her features trembled with an
ecstasy which he was dupe enough to believe was meant for him;
in reality Dorothea was thinking of the adventurer and the disclosure
of the secret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many years ago,&#8221; said Daniel, &#8220;you will scarcely recall it, I
protected you here in this very same gateway from a big dog. Do
you remember?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;No! Or do I? Wait a minute! Yes, I remember, that is,
quite indistinctly. You did that?&#8221; Dorothea seized his hands
with gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine! Then we will go walking to-morrow morning. Where?
Oh, it doesn&#8217;t make much difference,&#8221; said Daniel.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must tell me everything, you hear? everything.&#8221;
Dorothea was as insistent as she had been in the room a short while
ago; and she was more impetuous and impatient.</p>

<p>They agreed upon the place where they would meet.</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>At first they took short walks in remote parts of the city; then
they took longer ones. On Mid-Summer Day they strolled out to
Kraftshof and the grove of the Pegnitz shepherds. Daniel made
unconscious effort to avoid the places where he had once walked
with Eleanore.</p>

<p>There came moments when Dorothea&#8217;s exuberance made him
pensive and sad; he felt the weight of his forty years; they were
inclined to make him hypochondriacal. Was it the vengeance of
fate that made him slow up when they came to a hill, while
Dorothea ran on ahead and waited for him, laughing?</p>

<p>She did not see the flowers, the trees, the animals, or the clouds.
But when she saw people a change came over her: she would
become more active; or she would mobilise her resources; or she
seemed to strike up a spiritual liaison with them. It might be
only a peasant boy on an errand or a vagabond going nowhere;
she would shake her hips and laugh one note higher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her youth has gone to her head, like wine,&#8221; Daniel thought to
himself.</p>

<p>Once she took a box of chocolate bon-bons along. Having had
enough of them herself and seeing that Daniel did not care for
them, she threw what was left away. Daniel reproached her for
her wastefulness. &#8220;Why drag it along?&#8221; she asked with perfect
lack of embarrassment, &#8220;when you have enough of a thing you
throw it away.&#8221; She showed her white teeth, and took in one
deep breath of fresh air after another.</p>

<p>Daniel studied her. &#8220;She is invulnerable,&#8221; he said to himself;
&#8220;her power to wish is invincible, her fulness of life complete.&#8221;
He felt that she bore a certain resemblance to his Eva; that she
was one of those elves of light in whose cheerfulness there is occasionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>a touch of the terrible. He decided then and there not to
let mischievous chance have its own way: he was going to put out
his hand when he felt it was advisable.</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you going to begin to tell me the stories?&#8221; she asked:
&#8220;I must, I must know all about you,&#8221; she added with much warmth
of expression. &#8220;There are days and nights when I cannot rest.
Tell me! Tell me!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the truth. In order to penetrate his life history, which
she pictured to herself as full of passionate, checkered events, she
had done everything that he had demanded of her.</p>

<p>Daniel refused; he was silent; he was afraid he would darken
the girl&#8217;s pure mind, jeopardise her unsuspecting innocence. He
was afraid to conjure up the shadows.</p>

<p>One day she was talking along in her easy way, and while so
doing she tripped herself up. She had begun to tell him about
the men she had been going with; and before she knew what she
was doing, she had fallen into the tone she used when she talked
with her Uncle Carovius. Becoming suddenly aware of her indiscretion,
she stopped, embarrassed. Daniel&#8217;s serious questions caused
her to make some confessions she would otherwise never have
thought of making. She told a goodly number of rather murky
and ugly stories, and it was very hard for her to act as though she
were innocent or the victim of circumstances. At last, unable
longer to escape from the net she had woven, she made a clean
breast of her whole life, painted it all in the gaudiest colours, and
then waited in breathless&mdash;but agreeable&mdash;suspense to see what
effect it would have on Daniel.</p>

<p>Daniel was silent for a while; then he made a motion with his
outstretched hand as if he were cutting something in two: &#8220;Away
from them, Dorothea, or away from me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea bowed her head, and then looked at him timidly from
head to foot. The decisiveness with which he spoke was something
new to her, though it was by no means offensive. A voluptuous
shudder ran through her limbs. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she whispered girlishly,
&#8220;I am going to put an end to it. I never realised what it all
meant. But don&#8217;t be angry, will you? No, you won&#8217;t, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She came closer to him; her eyes were filled with tears. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be angry at me,&#8221; she said again, &#8220;poor Dorothea can&#8217;t help it. She
is not responsible for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did you come to do it?&#8221; asked Daniel. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see
how it was possible. Weren&#8217;t you disgusted to the very bottom
of your soul? How could you go about under God&#8217;s free heavens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>with such hyenas? Why, girl, the very thought of it fills me with
scepticism about everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What should I have done, Daniel?&#8221; she said, calling him by his
baptismal name for the first time. She spoke with a felicitous
mixture of submissiveness and boldness that touched and at the
same time enchanted him. &#8220;What should I have done? They
come and talk to you, and spin their nets about you; and at home
it is so dreary and lonely, and your heart is so empty and Father
is so mean, you haven&#8217;t got anybody else in the world to talk to.&#8221;
Such was her defence, effective even if more voluble than coherent.</p>

<p>They walked on. They were passing through a valley in the
forest. On either side were tall pine trees, the crowns of which
were lighted by the evening sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t play with Fate, Dorothea,&#8221; said Daniel. &#8220;It does
not permit smudging or muddling, if we are to stand the test. It
keeps a faultless ledger; the entries it makes on both sides are the
embodiment of accuracy. Debts that we contract must always be
paid, somehow, somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea felt that he was getting started; that the great, good
story was about to come. She stopped, spread her shawl on the
ground, and took a graceful position on it, all eyes and ears. Daniel
threw himself on the moss beside her.</p>

<p>And he told his story&mdash;into the moss where little insects were
creeping around. He never raised either his eye or his voice.
At times Dorothea had to bend over to hear him.</p>

<p>He told about Gertrude, her torpor, her awakening, her love,
her resignation. He told about Eleanore; told how he had loved
her without knowing it. He told how Eleanore, out of an excess
of passion and suffering, became his, how Gertrude wandered about
dazed, unhappy, lost, until she finally took her life: &#8220;Then we went
up to the attic, and found it on fire and her lifeless body hanging
from the rafter.&#8221;</p>

<p>He told how Gertrude had lived on as a shadow by the side of
Eleanore, and how Eleanore became a flower girl, and how Philippina
the inexplicable, and still inexplicable, had come into his
family, and how Gertrude&#8217;s child lived there like an unfed foundling,
and how the other child, the child he had had by the maid,
had found such a warm spot in his heart.</p>

<p>He told of his meeting the two sisters, their speaking and their
remaining silent, his seeing them in secret trysts, the moving about
from house to house and room to room, the singing of songs, his
experiences with the D&ouml;rmaul opera company, the light thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>on his drab life by a mask, his friend and the help he had received
from him, his separation from him, the brush-maker&#8217;s house on
St. James&#8217;s Place, the three queer old maids in the Long Row, the
days he spent at Castle Erfft, the old father of the two sisters
and his strange doings&mdash;all of this he described in the tone of a
man awakening from a deep sleep. There was a confidence in what
he said and the way he said it that mayhap terrified the hovering
spirits of the evening, though it did not fill Dorothea&#8217;s eyes, then
glistening like polished metal, with a more intimate or cordial
light.</p>

<p>When he looked up he felt he saw two sombre figures standing
on the edge of the forest; he felt he saw the two sisters, and that
they were casting mournful, reproachful glances at him.</p>

<p>He got up. &#8220;And all that,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;all that has been
drunk up, like rain by the parched earth, by a work on which I
have been labouring for the past seven years. For seven years.
Two more years, and I will give it to the world, provided this
unsteady globe has not fallen into the sun by that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea had a confused, haphazard idea as to the type of
man that was standing before her. She was seized with a prickling
desire for him such as she had thus far never experienced. She
began to love him, in her way. Something impelled her to seek
shelter by him, near him, somewhat as a bird flies under the crown
of a tree at the approach of a storm. Daniel interpreted the
timidity with which she put her arm in his as a sign of gratitude.</p>

<p>And in this mood he took her back to the city.</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>It was in this pulsing, urging, joyful mood that Daniel worked
at and completed the fifth movement of his symphony, a <i>scherzo</i>
of grand proportions, beginning with a clarinet figure that symbolised
laughing <i>sans-souci</i>. All the possibilities of joy developed
from this simple motif. Nor was retrospection or consolation lacking.
If the main themes, mindful of their former pre-eminence,
seemed inclined to widen the bed of their stream, they were
appeased and forced back into their original channel by artistic
and capriciously alternating means. Once all three themes flowed
along together, gaining strength apparently through their union,
rose to a wonderful fugue, and seemed to be just on the point of
gaining the victory when the whole orchestra, above the chord in
D sevenths, was seized by the waltz melody, those melancholy sister-strains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>were taken up by the violins, and fled, dirge-like, to their
unknown abodes. Just before the jubilant crescendo of the finale,
a bassoon solo held one of them fast on its distant, grief-stricken
heights.</p>

<p>Daniel sketched the sixth movement in the following fourteen
nights.</p>

<p>He was fully aware of the fact that he had never been able to
work this way before. When a man accomplishes the extraordinary,
he knows it. It seizes him like a disease, and fills him like a profound
dream.</p>

<p>At times he felt as though he must tell some one about it, even
if it were only Herr Carovius. But once the flame had died
down, he could not help but laugh at the temptation to which he
had felt himself subjected. &#8220;Patience,&#8221; he thought, feeling more
assured than ever, &#8220;patience, patience!&#8221;</p>

<p>Since his work on the manuscripts was completed and his connection
with the firm of Philander and Sons dissolved, he began to
look around for another position. He had saved in the course of
the last few years four thousand marks, but he wished to keep
this sum intact.</p>

<p>He learned that the position of organist at the Church of St.
&AElig;gydius was vacant; he went to the pastor, who recommended him
to his superiors. It was decided that he should play something
before the church consistory. This he did one morning in October.
The trial proved eminently successful to his exacting auditors.</p>

<p>He was appointed organist at St. &AElig;gydius&#8217;s at a salary of twelve
hundred marks a year. When he played on Sundays and holidays,
the people came into the church just to hear him.</p>


<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>Among the suitors for the hand of Dorothea on whom Andreas
D&ouml;derlein looked with special favour was the mill owner, a man
by the name of Weisskopf. Herr Weisskopf was passionately fond
of music. He had greatly admired Dorothea when she gave her
concert, and had sent her a laurel wreath.</p>

<p>One day Herr Weisskopf came in and took dinner with the
D&ouml;derleins. When he left, D&ouml;derlein said to his daughter: &#8220;My
dear Dorothea, from this day on you may consider yourself betrothed.
This admirable man desires to have you as his lawfully
wedded wife. It is a great good fortune; the man is as rich as
Cr&#339;sus.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p><p>Instead of making a reply, Dorothea laughed heartily. But she
knew that the time had come when something had to be done.
Her mobile face twitched with scorn, fear, and desire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think it over; sleep on it. I have promised Herr Weisskopf to
let him know to-morrow,&#8221; said D&ouml;derlein, black-browed.</p>

<p>A week before this, Andreas D&ouml;derlein, confidently expecting
that Herr Weisskopf would ask for the hand of his daughter, had
borrowed a thousand marks from him. The miller had loaned
him the money believing that he was thereby securing a promissory
note on Dorothea. D&ouml;derlein had placed himself under obligations,
and was consequently determined to carry out his plans with
regard to the marriage of his daughter.</p>

<p>But Dorothea&#8217;s behaviour made it safe to predict that objections
would be raised on her part. D&ouml;derlein was in trouble; he sought
distraction. Sixteen years ago he had begun an <i>opus</i> entitled &#8220;All
Souls: a Symphonic Picture.&#8221; Five pages of the score had been
written, and since then he had never undertaken creative work.
He rummaged around in his desk, found the score, went to the
piano, and tried to take up the thread where he had lost it sixteen
years ago. He tried to imagine the intervening time merely as a
pause, an afternoon siesta.</p>

<p>It would not go. He sighed. He sat before the instrument,
and stared at the paper like a schoolboy who has a problem to solve
but has forgotten the rule. He seemed to lament the loss of his
artistic ability. He felt so hollow. The notes grinned at him;
they mocked him. His thoughts turned involuntarily to the miller.
He improvised for a while. Dorothea stuck her head in the door
and sang: &#8220;Rhinegold, Rhinegold, pu-re gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was enraged; he got up, slammed the lid of the piano, took
his hat and top coat, left the house, and went out to see his friend
in the suburbs.</p>

<p>When he returned that night, he saw Dorothea standing in the
door with a man. It was the actor, Edmund Hahn. They were
carrying on a heated conversation in whispers. The man was holding
Dorothea by the arm, but when D&ouml;derlein became visible from
the unlighted street, he uttered an ugly oath and quickly disappeared.</p>

<p>Dorothea looked her father straight, and impudently, in the face,
and followed him into the dark house.</p>

<p>When they were upstairs and had lighted the lamp, D&ouml;derlein
turned to her, and asked her threateningly: &#8220;What do you mean
by these immodest associations? Tell me! I want an answer!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to marry your flour sack. That&#8217;s my answer,&#8221; said
Dorothea, with a defiant toss of her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said D&ouml;derlein, pale with rage and ploughing
through his hair with his fingers, &#8220;we&#8217;ll see. Get out of here!
I have no desire to lose my well-earned sleep on account of such
an ungrateful hussy. We&#8217;ll take up the subject again to-morrow
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning Dorothea hastened to Herr Carovius. &#8220;Uncle,&#8221;
she stammered, &#8220;he wants to marry me to that flour sack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes? Well, I suppose I&#8217;ll have to visit that second-rate musician
in his studio again and give him a piece of my mind. In the
meantime be calm, my child, be calm,&#8221; said he, stroking her brown
hair, &#8220;Old Carovius is still alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea nestled up to him, and smiled: &#8220;What would you say,
Uncle,&#8221; she began with a knavish and at the same time unusually
attentive expression in her face, &#8220;if I were to marry Daniel
Nothafft? You like him,&#8221; she continued in a flattering tone, and
held him fast by the shoulder when he started back, &#8220;you like him,
I know you do. I must marry somebody; for I do not wish to be
an old maid, and I can&#8217;t stand Father any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herr Carovius tore himself loose from her. &#8220;To the insane
asylum with you!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I would rather see you go to bed
with that meal sack. Is the Devil in you, you prostitute? If your
skin itches, scratch it, so far as I am concerned, but take a stable
boy to do it, as Empress Katherine of blessed memory did. Buy
fine dresses, bedizen yourself with tom-foolery of all shades and
colours, go to dances and lap up champagne, make music or throw
your damn fiddle on the dung heap, do anything you want to do,
I&#8217;ll pay for it; but that green-eyed phantast, that lunk-headed rat-catcher,
that woman-eater and music-box bird, no, no! Never!
Send him humping down the stairs and out the front door! For
God&#8217;s sake and the sake of all the saints, don&#8217;t marry him! Don&#8217;t,
I say. If you do, it&#8217;s all off between you and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was such a look of hate and fear in Herr Carovius&#8217;s face
that Dorothea was almost frightened. His hair was as towsled as
the twigs of an abandoned bird&#8217;s nest; water was dripping from the
corners of his mouth; his eyes were inflamed; his glasses were on
the tip of his nose.</p>

<p>Nothing could have made Dorothea more pleased with the story
Daniel had told her than Herr Carovius&#8217;s ravings. Her eyes were
opened wide, her mouth was thirsty. If she had hesitated at times
before, she did so no more. She loved money; greed was a part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>of her make-up from the hour she was born. But if Herr Carovius
had laid the whole of his treasures at her feet, and said to her,
&#8220;You may have them if you will renounce Daniel Nothafft,&#8221; she
would have replied, &#8220;Your money, my Daniel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something terribly strange and strong drew her to the man she
had just heard so volubly cursed. That sensual prickling was of
a more dangerous violence and warmth in his presence than in that
of any other man she had ever known; and she had known a
number. To her he was a riddle and a mystery; she wanted to
solve the one and clear up the other. He had possessed so many
women, indubitably more than he had confessed to her; and she
wished now to possess him. He was so quiet, so clever, so resolute:
she wanted his quietness, his cleverness, his resoluteness. She
wanted everything he had, his charm, his magic, his power over
men, all that he displayed and all that he concealed.</p>

<p>She thought of him constantly; she thought in truth of no one
else, and nothing else. Her thoughts fluttered about his picture,
shyly, greedily, and as playfully as a kitten. He had managed to
bring will power and unity into her senses. She wanted to have
him.</p>

<p>The rain beat against the window. Terrified at Dorothea&#8217;s
thoughtfulness, Herr Carovius pressed his hands to his cheeks. &#8220;I
see, I see, you want to leave me all alone,&#8221; he said in a tone that
sounded like the howling of a dog in the middle of the night.
&#8220;You want to deceive me, to surrender me to the enemy, to leave
me nothing, nothing but the privilege of sitting here and staring
at my four walls. I see, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be still, Uncle, nothing is going to happen. It is all a huge
joke,&#8221; said Dorothea with feigned good humour and kind intentions.
She walked to the door slowly, looking back every now and
then with a smile on her face.</p>


<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>It was early in the morning when Dorothea rang Daniel&#8217;s bell.
Philippina opened the door, but she did not wish to let Dorothea
in. She forced an entrance, however, and, standing in the door,
she inspected Philippina with the eye of arrogance, always a clear-sighted
organ.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, Philippin&#8217;, there&#8217;s something rotten here,&#8221; murmured
Philippina to herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p><p>Daniel was at work. He got up and looked at Dorothea, who
carefully closed the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I am, Daniel,&#8221; she said, and breathed a sigh of relief,
like a swimmer who has just reached the land.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it all about?&#8221; asked Daniel, seemingly ill inclined to
become excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done what you wanted me to do, Daniel: I have broken
away from them. I cannot tolerate Father a minute longer. Where
should I go if not to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel went up to her, and laid his hands on her shoulders.
&#8220;Girl, girl!&#8221; he said as if to warn her. He felt uneasy.</p>

<p>They looked into each other&#8217;s eyes for what seemed like an
eternity. Daniel was apparently trying to peer into the innermost
recesses of her soul. Dorothea&#8217;s eyes sparkled with daring;
she did not lower her lids. Suddenly, as if moved from within,
Daniel bent over and kissed her on the forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know who I am,&#8221; he said, and walked back and forth in
the room. &#8220;You know how I have lived and how I am living at
present. I am a guilty man, and a lonely man. My nature
craves tenderness, but is unable to give tenderness in return. My
lot is a hard one, and whoever decides to share it with me must
be able to bear her part of this hardness. I am frequently my own
enemy and the enemy of those who mean well by me. I am not
a humourist, and make a poor impression in society. I can be
gruff, offensive, spiteful, irreconcilable, and revengeful. I am
ugly, poor, and no longer young. Are you not afraid of your
twenty-three years, Dorothea?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea shook her head vigorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Test yourself, Dorothea, examine yourself,&#8221; he continued
urgently, &#8220;don&#8217;t be too inexact, too careless with me, nor with
yourself. Study the situation from all sides, so that we may make
no false calculations. Fate, you know, is fate. Love can get
control of me more than I can get control of myself, and when
this takes place I will do everything in my power. But I must
have confidence, unlimited confidence. If I were to lose confidence,
I should be like a mortal proscribed to Hell, an outcast, an
evil spirit. Examine yourself, Dorothea. You must know what
you are doing; it is your affair, and it is a sacred one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot do otherwise, Daniel!&#8221; cried Dorothea, and threw
herself on his bosom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then God be merciful to us,&#8221; said Daniel.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p><h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>Daniel took Dorothea over to Sylvia von Erfft&#8217;s at Siegmundshof.
He had written to her, given her all the details, explained the
entire situation, and begged her to take Dorothea in and entertain
her until the day of the wedding. Sylvia had shown herself most
obliging in the matter; she met his requests with unaffected cordiality.</p>

<p>Dorothea had spent two nights at home, during which she had
succeeded in evading all explanations with her father. She did
this by having him agree to give her three days to think it over.
On the morning of the third day, after her father had gone to
the conservatory, she packed up her belongings and left the house.</p>

<p>Andreas D&ouml;derlein found the following letter from her: &#8220;Dear
Father: Abandon all your hopes with regard to my marrying Herr
Weisskopf. I am of age and can marry whomsoever I wish. I
have already made my choice. The man who is going to lead me
to the altar is called Daniel Nothafft. He loves me perhaps even
more than I deserve, and I will make him a good wife. This is
my unalterable decision, and you yourself will certainly come to
see that it is nobler to obey the impulses of one&#8217;s own heart than
to allow one&#8217;s self to be led on and blinded by material considerations.
Your loving daughter, Dorothea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andreas D&ouml;derlein had a sinking spell. The letter slipped from
his fingers and fell to the floor. Trembling in his whole body,
he walked up to the covered table, took a glass and hurled it against
the wall. The glass broke into a thousand pieces. &#8220;I will choke
you, you impious toad!&#8221; he panted, shook his clenched fist, went to
Dorothea&#8217;s room, and, seized with boundless wrath, upset the chairs
and the little dressing table.</p>

<p>The maid, terrified, ran into the living room. She saw Dorothea&#8217;s
letter lying on the floor, picked it up, and read it. When
she heard her mad master returning, she ran down stairs to the
ground floor, rang Herr Carovius&#8217;s bell, and showed him the letter.
His face turned yellow as he read it. The maid uttered a shrill,
piercing cry, snatched the letter from Herr Carovius&#8217;s hands, and
ran out into the court, for she heard Andreas D&ouml;derlein stumbling
down the steps. He wanted to call the police and have them
lock up the abductor of his daughter. Catching sight of Herr
Carovius in the hall, he stopped and fixed his eyes on him. In
them there was a sea of anger; and yet it was obvious that Andreas
D&ouml;derlein was eager to ask a question or two. It seemed indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>that just one conciliatory statement, even a single gesture on the
part of the man whom he had scrupulously avoided for years,
would make bye-gones be bye-gones and convert two implacable
foes into friends, colleagues indeed in the business of revenge and
punishment.</p>

<p>But Herr Carovius was done with the world. His face was
distorted; grimaces of unrelieved meanness furrowed his brow; his
contempt knew no bounds. He turned about and slammed the
door leading into his apartment with a bang that showed his intention
of shutting himself up in his own stronghold.</p>

<p>Andreas D&ouml;derlein got as far as the entrance to the Town Hall.
There he was suddenly seized with grave doubts. He stared at
the pavement for a while, sad and sinister, and then started back
home. His steps were not half so impetuous as they had been
on the way over; they gave evidence of weakened will and fading
energy.</p>

<p>Hardly had he reached home when Daniel was announced.
&#8220;You have the boldness, Sir,&#8221; he cried out to Daniel on his entering.
&#8220;You have the boldness to appear in my sight? By the
gods above, you are going far!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will accept any challenge you make,&#8221; said Daniel, with the
chilly dignity that was characteristic of him in such circumstances
and that never failed to have a sobering effect on his potential
antagonist. &#8220;I have nothing to fear. I should like to live in
peace with the father of my wife, and for this reason I have come
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what you are doing to me? You have stolen my
daughter, man!&#8221; cried D&ouml;derlein with pathos. &#8220;But just wait.
I will checkmate your plans. I will make you feel the full measure
of my power.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel smiled contemptuously. &#8220;I am certain of that,&#8221; he
replied. &#8220;I will feel your power as long as I live; I have always
felt it. But I have never submitted to it, and up to the present I
have always been able to break it. Think it over! Recall my past
history! And devote a few of your meditative moments to your
child. Adieu!&#8221; With that Daniel left.</p>

<p>Andreas D&ouml;derlein was ill at ease. The man&#8217;s smile followed
him wherever he went. What could the desperado be planning?
A bad conscience paralyses evil determinations. For more than a
week, D&ouml;derlein waged perpetual war with his pride. And then?
Daniel did not allow himself to be seen; he received no news
of any kind from Dorothea; and, climax of it all, Herr Weisskopf
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>notified him that his note for one thousand marks, with interest,
was due. D&ouml;derlein saw that there was nothing to be done about
it all except to recognise the d&eacute;nouement as a fact and not as a
stage scene. And one day he hobbled up the steps of the house
on &AElig;gydius Place.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you,&#8221; said Daniel as he reached out his hand
to his visitor.</p>

<p>Andreas D&ouml;derlein spoke of a father&#8217;s bleeding heart, of the
crushing of proud hopes, of the impiety of youth, and the lonesomeness
of old age. And then, rather disconnectedly, beating a
tattoo with the fingers of his big hand on the top of the table, he
spoke of the constraint in which he found himself with reference
to the opulent owner of the mill. He told Daniel he had gone
on a man&#8217;s note, had been suddenly obliged to redeem the note, and
not having so much ready money at his disposal, had accepted a
loan from the rich aspirant for Dorothea&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>Daniel was forced to admit that his troubles were humiliating
and that the money would have to be raised. D&ouml;derlein said it
amounted to fifteen hundred marks. He was surprised himself
when he mentioned the sum which assured him a clear gain of
fifty per cent. It had been a clever idea, serving as it did to put
the generosity of his future son-in-law to test. At the bottom of
his heart he felt that his action was dishonourable, and was consequently
touched when Daniel, giving this inroad on his savings
but a moment&#8217;s thought, promised to send him the money the
following day.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make me feel ashamed of myself, Daniel, really you do.
Let us bury the hatchet! We are after all colleagues in Apollo.
Or aren&#8217;t we? Call me Father, and I will call you Son! Address
me with <i>Du</i>, and I will follow your example.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel gave him his hand without saying a word.</p>

<p>D&ouml;derlein asked about Dorothea; and when Daniel told him
where she was, he seemed quite contented. &#8220;Tell her my house
and my arms are open to her; tell her of the change in the constellation,&#8221;
he said softly. &#8220;We have both done each other injustice
and have both repented.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel replied quite conventionally that he thought it better
to leave Dorothea with Sylvia von Auffenberg.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you wish, my son,&#8221; said Andreas D&ouml;derlein, &#8220;I bow to the
claims of your young happiness. Now we should have a bottle
of Malvoisie or Moselle, so that I can drink to the health of my
dear, unruly daughter. Or don&#8217;t you care to?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p><p>Daniel went to send Philippina to the Golden Posthorn. But
Philippina had gone out with Agnes. He saw one of the maids
from one of the other apartments standing on the steps, and got
her to run the errand. It was a long while before she returned,
and when the wine was finally poured out, D&ouml;derlein had not time
to drink: he was scheduled to give a lecture in the conservatory at
seven. He drank about half of his glass, and then took hasty leave
of Daniel, shaking his hand with unwonted fervour.</p>

<p>Daniel sat for a while thinking it all over. There was a knock
at the door, and old Jordan came in. &#8220;May I?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Daniel nodded. Jordan took a seat on the chair D&ouml;derlein had
been sitting on. He looked into Daniel&#8217;s face quizzically. &#8220;Is it
true, Daniel, that you are going to get married again? That you
are going to marry the D&ouml;derlein girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Father, it is true,&#8221; replied Daniel. He got a fresh glass,
filled it, and pushed it over to the old man. &#8220;Drink, Father!&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>The old man sipped the wine with an air of adoration. &#8220;It
must be nine or ten years since I have had any wine,&#8221; he said more
or less to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not had a happy life,&#8221; replied Daniel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not complain, Daniel. I bear it because I have to. And
who knows? Perhaps there is still a measure of joy in store for
me. Perhaps; who knows?&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men sat in silence and drank. It was so still that you
could hear the fluttering of the light in the lamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can Philippina be?&#8221; asked Daniel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Philippina. I had forgot to tell you,&#8221; began old Jordan
sorrowfully. &#8220;She came to me this afternoon, and told me she
was going over to Frau Hadebusch&#8217;s with Agnes and was going
to stay there until after the wedding. But she spoke in such a
confused way that I couldn&#8217;t make out just what she planned to do.
It sounded in fact as though she were thinking of leaving the
house for good and all. I wonder whether the girl isn&#8217;t a little
off in her head? Day before yesterday I heard an awful racket
in the kitchen; and when I went down, I saw at least six plates
lying on the floor all smashed to pieces. And as if this was not
enough, she threatened to throw the dishwater on me. She was
swearing like a trooper. Now tell me: how is this? Can she go
over to Frau Hadebusch&#8217;s, and take Agnes with her without getting
any one&#8217;s consent?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel made no reply. The thought of Philippina filled him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>with anguish; he feared some misfortune. He felt that he would
have to let her have her way.</p>


<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>In the night Daniel became very much excited. He left the
house, and, despite the darkness and the snow storm, wandered
out to the country quite unmindful of the cold and snow and
the wind.</p>

<p>He listened to the whisperings of his soul; he took council
with himself. He looked up at the great black vaulted arch of
heaven as though he were beseeching the powers above to send
him the light he felt he needed. The morning of the approaching
day seemed bleaker, blacker to him than the night that was
passing. He was lost in anxiety: he went over to his graves.</p>

<p>He did not stop to think until well on his way that the gate
to the cemetery would be closed; but he kept on going. He
looked around for a place in the wall where he might climb over.
Finally he found one, climbed up, scratched his hands painfully,
leaped down into some snow-covered hedges, and then wandered
around with his burden of grief over the stormy, desolate field of
the dead. As he stood before Gertrude&#8217;s grave he was overwhelmed
with the feeling of the hour: there were voices in the storm; he
felt that the horror and the memory of it all would hurl him to
the ground. But when he stood by the grave of Eleanore, he felt
his peace return. The clouds suddenly opened on the distant
horizon, and a moonbeam danced about him.</p>

<p>It was almost morning when he reached home.</p>

<p>A week later he went over to Siegmundshof and got Dorothea.</p>

<p>Sylvia and Dorothea came down through a snow-covered alley
to meet him. They were walking arm in arm, and Sylvia was
laughing at Dorothea&#8217;s easy-flowing conversation. They seemed to
be getting along perfectly together: there could be no mistaking
the picture he saw before him. Sylvia told Daniel when she was
alone with him that she had taken a great liking to Dorothea. She
remarked that her cheerfulness was irresistible and contagious, and
that when she was with children she became a child herself.</p>

<p>Yet, despite all this, Sylvia studied Daniel. And when Dorothea
was present she studied her too: she cast fleeting, searching, unassured
glances at them&mdash;at Daniel and at Dorothea.</p>

<p>Daniel and Dorothea were married on a sunny day in December.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">For</span> the past fortnight, Philippina and Agnes had been living
at Frau Hadebusch&#8217;s. A message came from Daniel telling Philippina
that she and Agnes should return, or, if she preferred to stay
with Frau Hadebusch, she should send Agnes home at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you have it,&#8221; said Frau Hadebusch, &#8220;the master speaks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, him&mdash;he&#8217;s been speakin&#8217; to me for a long while. Much
good it does him,&#8221; said Philippina. &#8220;The child stays with me,
and I&#8217;m not going back. That settles it! What, Agnes? Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Agnes was sitting on the bench by the stove with Henry the idiot,
reading the greasy pages of a cheap novel. When Philippina
spoke to her, she looked up in a distracted way and smiled. The
twelve-year-old child had a perfectly expressionless face; and as
she never got out of the house for any length of time, her skin
was almost yellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t no use to try to buck him,&#8221; continued Frau Hadebusch,
who looked as old as the mountains and resembled generally a
crippled witch, &#8220;he c&#8217;n demand the kid, and if he does he&#8217;ll git
her. If you ain&#8217;t careful, I&#8217;ll get mixed up in the mess before
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how do you feel about it, Agnes? Do you want to go
back to your daddy?&#8221; said Philippina, turning to the girl, and
looking at Frau Hadebusch in a knowing way.</p>

<p>Agnes&#8217;s face clouded up. She hated her father. This was
the point to which Philippina had brought matters by her incessant
whisperings and ugly remarks behind Daniel&#8217;s back. Agnes
was convinced that she was a burden to her father, and his marriage
had merely confirmed what she already felt she knew. Deep
in her silent soul she carried the picture of her prematurely deceased
mother, as if it were that of a woman who had been murdered,
sacrificed. Philippina had told her how her mother had committed
suicide; it was a fearful tale in her language. It had been the
topic of conversation between her and her charge on many a cold,
dark winter evening. Agnes always said that when she was big
and could talk, she would take vengeance on her father.</p>

<p>When she could talk! That was her most ardent wish. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>she was silent-born. Her soul pined in a prison that was much
harsher and harder than that in which her mother&#8217;s soul had been
housed and harassed. Gertrude had some bright moments; Agnes
never. She was incapable of enthusiasm; she could not look up.
For her heart, her soul was not merely asleep, torpid, lethargic;
it was hopelessly dried up, withered. Life was not in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to those D&ouml;derleins,&#8221; she said, crying.</p>

<p>But in the evening Daniel came over. He took Philippina to
one side, and had a serious talk with her. He explained the reasons
for his getting married a third time as well as he could
without going too deeply into the subject. &#8220;I needed a wife; I
needed a woman to keep house for me; I needed a companion.
Philippina, I am very grateful to you for what you have done, but
there must also be a woman in my home who can cheer me up,
turn my thoughts to higher things. I have a heavy calling; that
you cannot appreciate. So don&#8217;t get stubborn, Philippina. Pack
up your things, and come back home. How can we get along
without you?&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time in his life he spoke to her as though she
were a woman and a human being. Philippina stared at him.
Then she burst out into a loud, boisterous laugh, and began to
show her whole supply of scorn. &#8220;Jesus, Daniel, how you c&#8217;n flatter
a person! Who&#8217;d a thought it! You&#8217;ve always been such a sour
dough. Very well. Say: &#8216;Dear Philippina!&#8217; Say it real slow:
&#8216;D-e-a-r Philippina,&#8217; and then I&#8217;ll come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel looked into the face of the girl, who never did seem
young and who had aged fearfully in the last few months. &#8220;Nonsense!&#8221;
he cried, and turned away.</p>

<p>Philippina stamped the floor with her foot. Henry, the idiot,
came out into the hall, holding a lamp above his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does the sanctimonious clerk still live here?&#8221; asked Daniel,
looking up at the crooked old stairway, while a flood of memories
came rushing over him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, no!&#8221; snarled Philippina. &#8220;He&#8217;d be the last
straw. I feel sick at the stomach when I see a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel again looked into her detestable, ugly, distorted, and
wicked face. He was accustomed to question everything, eyes and
bodies, about their existence in terms of tones, or their transformation
into tones. Here he suddenly felt the toneless; he had
the feeling one might have on looking at a deep-sea fish: it is lifeless,
toneless. He thought of his Eva; he longed for his Eva.
Just then Agnes came out of the door to look for Philippina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p><p>He laid his hand on Agnes&#8217;s hair, and said good-naturedly,
looking at Philippina: &#8220;Well, then&mdash;d-e-a-r Philippina, come back
home!&#8221;</p>

<p>Agnes jerked herself away from him; he looked at the child
amazed; he was angry, too. Philippina folded her hands, bowed
her head, and murmured with much humility: &#8220;Very well, Daniel,
we&#8217;ll be back to-morrow.&#8221;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Philippina arrived at the front door at ten o&#8217;clock in the morning.
In one hand she carried her bundle; by the other she led
Agnes, then studying her <i>milieu</i> with uneasy eyes.</p>

<p>Dorothea opened the door. She was neatly and tastefully
dressed: she wore a blue gingham dress and a white apron with a
lace border. Around her neck was a gold chain, and suspended
from the chain a medallion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the children!&#8221; she cried cheerfully, &#8220;Philippina and Agnes.
What do you think of that! God bless you, children. You are
home at last.&#8221; She wanted to hug Agnes, but the child pulled
away from her as timidly as she had pulled away from her father
yesterday. In either case, she pulled away!</p>

<p>Philippina screwed her mouth into a knot on hearing a woman
ten years her junior call her a child; she looked at Dorothea from
head to foot.</p>

<p>Dorothea scarcely noticed her. &#8220;Just imagine, Philippin&#8217;, the
cook didn&#8217;t come to-day, so I thought I would try my own hand,&#8221;
said Dorothea with glib gravity, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t know, the soup meat
is still as hard as a rock. Won&#8217;t you come and see what&#8217;s the
matter?&#8221; She took Philippina into the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;ve got to have a lid on the pot, and what&#8217;s more,
that ain&#8217;t a regular fire,&#8221; remarked Philippina superciliously.</p>

<p>Dorothea had already turned to something else. She had found
a glass of preserved fruit, had opened it, taken a long-handled
spoon, dived into it, put the spoon to her mouth, and was licking
away for dear life. &#8220;Tastes good,&#8221; she said, &#8220;tastes like lemon.
Try it, Philippin&#8217;.&#8221; She held the spoon to Philippina&#8217;s lips so that
she could try it. Philippina thrust the spoon rudely to one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, you have got to try it. I insist. Taste it!&#8221; continued
Dorothea, and poked the spoon tightly against Philippina&#8217;s lips.
&#8220;I insist, I insist,&#8221; she repeated, half beseechingly, half in the
tone of a command, so that Philippina, who somehow or other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>could not find her veteran power of resistance, and in order to
have peace, let the spoon be shoved into her mouth.</p>

<p>Just then old Jordan came out into the hall, and with him the
chimney-sweeper who wished to clean the chimney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Inspector, Herr Inspector,&#8221; cried Dorothea, laughing;
and when the old man followed her call, she gave him a spoonful,
too. The chimney-sweep likewise; he had to have his. And last
but not least came Agnes.</p>

<p>They all laughed; a faint smile even ventured across Agnes&#8217;s
pale face, while Daniel, frightened from his room by the hubbub,
came out and stood in the kitchen door and laughed with the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see, Daniel, do you see? They all eat out of my
hand,&#8221; said Dorothea contentedly. &#8220;They all eat out of my hand.
That&#8217;s the way I like to have things. To your health, folks!&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>One afternoon Dorothea, with an open letter in her hand, came
rushing into Daniel&#8217;s room, where he was working.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Daniel, Frau Feistelmann invites me over to a party at
her house to-morrow. May I go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are disturbing me, my dear. Can&#8217;t you see you are upsetting
me?&#8221; asked Daniel reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; breathed Dorothea, and looked helplessly at the stack
of scores that lay on the top of the table. &#8220;I am to take my
violin along and play a piece or two for the people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel gazed into space without being able to comprehend her
remarks. He was composing.</p>

<p>Dorothea lost her patience. She stepped up to the place on the
wall where the mask of Zingarella had been hanging since his
return home. &#8220;Daniel, I have been wanting for some time to ask
you what that thing is. Why do you keep it there? What&#8217;s it
for? It annoys me with its everlasting grin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel woke up. &#8220;That is what you call a grin?&#8221; he asked, shaking
his head; &#8220;Is it possible? That smile from the world beyond
appeals to you as a grin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Dorothea defiantly, &#8220;the thing is grinning. And
I don&#8217;t like it; I can&#8217;t stand that silly face; I don&#8217;t like it simply
because you do like it so much. In fact, you seem to like it better
than you do me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No childishness, Dorothea!&#8221; said Daniel quietly. &#8220;You must
get your mind on higher things; and you must respect my spirits.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p><p>Dorothea became silent. She did not understand him. She
looked at him with a touch of distrust. She thought the mask
was a picture of one of his old sweethearts. She made a mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said something about playing at the party, Dorothea,&#8221;
continued Daniel. &#8220;Do you realise that I never heard you play?
I will frankly confess to you that heretofore I have been afraid to
hear you. I could tolerate only the excellent; or the promise of
excellence. You may show both; and yet, what is the cause of
my fear? You have not practised in a long while; not once since
we have been living together. And yet you wish to play in
public? That is strange, Dorothea. Be so good as to get your
violin and play a piece for me, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea went into the next room, got her violin case, came
out, took the violin, and began to rub the bow with rosin. As
she was tuning the A&nbsp;string, she lifted her eyebrows and said: &#8220;Do
you really want me to play?&#8221;</p>

<p>She bit her lips and played an <i>&eacute;tude</i> by Fiorillo. Having finished
it but not having drawn a word of comment from Daniel,
she again took up the violin and played a rather lamentable selection
by Wieniawski.</p>

<p>Daniel maintained his silence for a long while. &#8220;Pretty good,
Dorothea,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;You have, other things being equal,
a very pleasant pastime there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Dorothea with noticeable rapidity,
a heavy blush colouring her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it anything more than that, Dorothea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she repeated, embarrassed and indignant.
&#8220;I should think that my violin is more than a pastime.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel got up, walked over to her, took the bow gently from her
hands, seized it by both ends, and broke it in two.</p>

<p>Dorothea screamed, and looked at him in hopeless consternation.</p>

<p>With great earnestness Daniel replied: &#8220;If the music I hear is
not of unique superiority, it sounds in my ears like something
that has been hashed over a thousand times. My wife must consider
herself quite above a reasonably melodious dilettantism.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tears rushed to Dorothea&#8217;s eyes. Again she was unable to grasp
the meaning of it all. She even imagined that Daniel was making
a conscious effort to be cruel to her.</p>

<p>For her violin playing had been a means of pleasing&mdash;pleasing
herself, the world. It had been a means of rising in the world,
of compelling admiration in others and blinding others. This was
the only consideration that made her submit to the stern discipline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>her father imposed upon her. She possessed ambition, but she
sold herself to praise without regard for the praiser. And whatever
an agreement of unknown origin demanded in the way of feeling,
she fancied she could satisfy it by keeping her mind on her own
wishes, pleasures, and delights while playing.</p>

<p>Daniel put his arms around her and kissed her. She broke away
from him in petulance, and went over to the window. &#8220;You
might have told me that I do not play well enough for you,&#8221; she
exclaimed angrily and sobbed; &#8220;there was no need for you to break
my bow. I never play. It never occurred to me to bother you
by playing.&#8221; She wept like a spoiled child.</p>

<p>It cost Daniel a good deal of persuasion to pacify her. Finally
he saw that there was no use to talk to her; he sighed and said
nothing more. After a while he took her pocket handkerchief,
and dried the tears from her eyes, laughing as he did so. &#8220;What
was really in my mind was that party at Frau Feistelmann&#8217;s. I did
not want you to go. For I do not put much faith in that kind of
entertainment. They do not enrich you, though they do incite all
kinds of desires. But because I have treated you harshly, you may
go. Possibly it will make you forget your troubles, you little
fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I thank you for your offer; but I don&#8217;t want to go,&#8221;
replied Dorothea snappishly, and left the room.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Yet Dorothea said the next day at the dinner table that she was
going to accept the invitation. It would be much easier just to go
and have it over with, she remarked, than to stay away and explain
her absence. She said this in a way that would lead you to believe
that it had cost her much effort to come to her decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, go!&#8221; said Daniel. &#8220;I have already advised you to do
it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had had a dark blue velvet dress made, and she wanted to
wear it for the first time on this occasion.</p>

<p>Toward five o&#8217;clock Daniel went to his bedroom. He saw
Dorothea standing before the mirror in her new dress. It was a
tall, narrow mirror on a console. Dorothea had received it from
her father as a wedding present.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter with her?&#8221; thought Daniel, on noticing
her complete lack of excitement. She was as if lost in the reflection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>of herself in the mirror. There was something rigid, drawn,
transported about her eyes. She did not see that Daniel was standing
in the room. When she raised her arm and turned her head,
it was to enjoy these gestures in the mirror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dorothea!&#8221; said Daniel gently.</p>

<p>She started, looked at him thoughtfully, and smiled a heady
smile.</p>

<p>Daniel was anxious, apprehensive.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>&#8220;I am related to Daniel, and we must address each other by the
familiar <i>Du</i>,&#8221; said Philippina to Dorothea. Daniel&#8217;s wife agreed.</p>

<p>Every morning when Dorothea came into the kitchen Philippina
would say: &#8220;Well, what did you dream?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dreamt I was at the station and it was wartime, and some
gipsies came along and carried me off,&#8221; said Dorothea on one
occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Station means an unexpected visit; war means discord with
various personalities; and gipsies mean that you are going to have
to do with some flippant people.&#8221; All this Philippina rattled off in
the High German of her secret code.</p>

<p>Philippina was also an adept in geomancy. Dorothea would
often sit by her side, and ask her whether this fellow or that fellow
were in love with her, whether this girl loved that fellow and
the other girl another, and so on through the whole table of local
infatuations. Philippina would make a number of dots on a sheet
of paper, fill in the numbers, hold the list up to the light, and
divulge the answer of the oracle.</p>

<p>In a very short while the two were one heart, one soul. Dorothea
could always count on Philippina&#8217;s laughter of approval when
she fell into one of her moods of excessive friskiness. And if
Agnes failed to show the proper amount of interest, Philippina
would poke her in the ribs and exclaim: &#8220;You little rascallion, has
the cat got your tongue?&#8221;</p>

<p>Agnes would then sneak off in mournful silence to her school
books, and sit for hours over the simplest kind of a problem in the
whole arithmetic. Dorothea would occasionally bring her a piece
of taffy. She would wrap it up, put it in her pocket, and give it
the next day to a schoolmate from whose note book she had copied
her sums in subtraction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p><p>Herr Seelenfromm stopped Philippina on the street, and said to
her: &#8220;Well, how are you getting along? How is the young wife
making out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, oi, we&#8217;re living on the fat of the land, I say,&#8221; Philippina
replied, stretching her mouth from ear to ear. &#8220;Chicken every
day, cake too, wine always on hand, and one guest merely opens
the door on another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothafft must have made a pile of money,&#8221; remarked Herr
Seelenfromm in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he must. Nobody works at our house. The wife&#8217;s pocket-book
at least is always crammed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sky was blue, the sun was bright, spring had come.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Andreas D&ouml;derlein always took Sunday dinner with his children.
He loved a juicy leg of pork, a salad garnished with greens and
eggs, and a tart drowned in sugar. Old Jordan, who was privileged
to sit at the table, let the individual morsels dissolve on his tongue.
He had never had such delicacies placed before him in his life.
At times he would cast a glance of utter astonishment at Daniel.</p>

<p>He very rarely took part in the conversation. As soon as the
dishes had been removed, he would get up and quietly go to his
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;A very remarkable old man,&#8221; said Andreas D&ouml;derlein one Sunday,
as he sat tipped back on his chair, picking his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, we have our troubles with him,&#8221; said Dorothea abusively,
&#8220;he is an incorrigible pot-watcher. He comes to the kitchen ten
times a day, sticks his nose up in the air, asks what we are going
to have for dinner, and then goes out and stands in the hall, with
the result that our guests come and stumble over him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andreas D&ouml;derlein emitted a growl of lament.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are your finances, my son?&#8221; he asked, turning to Daniel
with an air of marked affability. &#8220;Would you not like to bolster
up your income by taking a position in the conservatory? You
would have time for it; your work as organist at St. &AElig;gydius does
not take up all your time. Herold is going to be retired, you
know. He is seventy-five and no longer able to meet the requirements.
All that we will have to do will be for me to give you
my backing. Three thousand marks a year, allocation to your
widow after ten years of service, extra fees&mdash;I should think you
would regard that as a most enticing offer. Or don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p><p>Dorothea ran up to her father in a spirit of unrestrained jubilation,
threw her arms around his bulky body, and kissed him on his
flabby cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;No thanks to me, my child,&#8221; said the Olympian; &#8220;to stand
by you two is of course my duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of a swollen stranger is that, anyhow?&#8221; thought
Daniel to himself. &#8220;What does he want of me? Why does he
come into my house and sit down at my table? Why is he so
familiar with me? Why does he blow his breath on me?&#8221; Daniel
was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand, my dear son, that you would abandon your
leisure hours only with the greatest reluctance,&#8221; continued D&ouml;derlein
with concealed sarcasm, &#8220;but after all, who can live precisely
as he would like to live? Who can follow his own inclinations
entirely? The everyday feature of human existence is powerful.
Icarus must fall to the earth. With your wife anticipating a
happy event, you cannot, of course, hesitate in the face of such
an offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel cast an angry look at Dorothea.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will think it over,&#8221; said Daniel, got up, and left the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is unpleasant for him,&#8221; complained Dorothea; &#8220;he values his
leisure above everything else in the world. But I will do all in
my power to bring him around, Father. And you keep at him.
He will resist and object. I know him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus it was brought to light that Daniel was no longer a mysterious
and unfathomable individual in her estimation. She had
found him out; she had divined him, in her way to be sure. He
was much simpler than she had imagined, and at times she was
really a bit angry at him for not arousing her curiosity more than
he did. What she had fancied as highly interesting, thrilling,
intoxicating, had proved to be quite simple and ordinary. The
charm was gone, never to return. Her sole diversion lay in her
attempts to get complete control over him through the skilful
manipulation of her senses and her priceless youth.</p>

<p>Daniel felt that she was disappointed; he had been afraid of this
all along. His anxiety increased with time, for it was evident
that everything he said or did disappointed her. His anxiety
caused him to be indulgent, where he had formerly been unbending.
The difference in their ages made him patient and tractable.
He feared he could not show her the love that she in her freshness
and natural, unconsumed robustness desired. On this account
he denied himself many things which he formerly could not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>got along without, and put up with, many things that would have
been intolerable to him as a younger man.</p>

<p>It needed only a single hour at night to make him promise to
accept the position old Herold was leaving. He, as parsimonious
with words as in the expression of feelings, succumbed to her cat-like
cuddling. He capitulated in the face of her unpitying ridicule,
and surrendered all to the prurient agility of a young body.
Dark powers there are that set up dependencies between man and
woman. When they rule, things do not work out in accordance
with set calculation or inborn character. It takes but a single hour
of the night to bend the most sacred truth of life into a lie.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>In the course of time Daniel had to provide for an increase in
his annual salary. Dorothea had made a great many innovations
that cost money. She had bought a dressing table, a number of
cabinets, and a bath tub. The lamps, dishes, bed covers, and
curtains she found old-fashioned, and simply went out and bought
new ones.</p>

<p>Nothing gave her greater pleasure than to go shopping. Then
the bills came in, and Daniel shook his head. He begged her to
be more saving, but she would fall on his neck, and beseech and
beseech until he acceded to every single one of her wishes.</p>

<p>She rarely came home with empty hands. It may have been
only little things that she bought, a manikin of porcelain with a
tile hat and an umbrella, or a pagoda with a wag-head, or even
merely a mouse-trap&mdash;but they all cost money.</p>

<p>Philippina would be called in; Philippina was to admire the
purchases. And she would say with apparent delight: &#8220;Now ain&#8217;t
that sweet!&#8221; Or, &#8220;Now that&#8217;s fine; we needed a mouse-trap so
bad! There was a mouse on the clothes rack just yesterday, cross
my heart, Daniel.&#8221;</p>

<p>As to hats, dresses, stockings, shoes, laces, and blouses&mdash;when it
came to these Dorothea was a stranger to such concepts as measure
or modesty. She wanted to compete with the wives of the rich
people whose parties she attended, and next to whom she sat in
the pastry shop or at the theatre.</p>

<p>She was given free tickets to the theatre and the concerts. But
once when she had told Daniel that the director had sent her a
ticket, he learned from Philippina that she had bought the ticket
and paid for it with her own money. He did not call her to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>account, but he could not get the thought out of his mind that she
had believed she had deceived him.</p>

<p>He did not accompany her on her pleasure jaunts; he wanted to
work and not double even the smallest expenditure by going with
her. Dorothea had become accustomed to this. She looked upon
his apathy toward the theatre and his dislike of social distractions
as a caprice, a crotchet on his part. She never considered what
he had gone through in the way of theatricals and concerts; she
had completely forgotten what he had confessed to her in a decisive
hour.</p>

<p>When she came home late in the evening with burning cheeks
and glowing eyes, Daniel did not have the courage to give her
the advice he felt she so sorely needed. &#8220;Why snatch her from
her heaven?&#8221; he thought. &#8220;She will become demure and quiet in
time; her wild lust for pleasure will fade and disappear.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was afraid of her pouting mien, her tears, her perplexed
looks, her defiant running about. But he lacked the words to
express himself. He knew how ineffectual warning and reproach
might be and were. Empty talking back and forth he could not
stand, while if he made a really human remark it found no response.
She did not appreciate what he said; she misunderstood,
misinterpreted everything. She laughed, shrugged her shoulders,
pouted, called him an old grouch, or cooed like a dove. She did
not look at him with real eyes; there was no flow of soul in what
she did.</p>

<p>Gloom filled his heart.</p>

<p>The waste in the household affairs became worse and worse from
week to week. Daniel would have felt like a corner grocer if he
had never let her know how much he had saved, or had given her
less than she asked for. And so his money was soon all gone.
Dorothea troubled herself very little about the economic side of
their married life. She told Philippina what to do, and fell into
a rage if her orders were not promptly obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too dull for her here. My God, such a young woman!&#8221;
said Philippina to Daniel with simulated regret. &#8220;She wants to
have a good time; she wants to enjoy her life. And you can&#8217;t
blame her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina was the mistress of the house. She went to the
market, paid the bills, superintended the cook and the washwoman,
and rejoiced with exceeding great and fiendish joy when she saw
how rapidly everything was going downhill, downhill irresistibly
and as sure as your life.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p><h3>VIII</h3>

<p>As the time approached for Dorothea&#8217;s confinement she very
rarely left the house. She would lie in bed until about eleven
o&#8217;clock, when she would get up, dress, comb her hair, go through
her wardrobe, and write letters.</p>

<p>She carried on a most elaborate correspondence; those who
received her letters praised her amusing style.</p>

<p>After luncheon she would go back to bed; and late in the afternoon
her visitors came in, not merely women but all sorts of young
men. It often happened that Daniel did not even know the names
of the people. He would withdraw to the room Eleanore had
formerly occupied, and from which he could hear laughter and
loud talk resounding through the hall.</p>

<p>By evening Dorothea was tired. She would sit in the rocking
chair and read the newspaper, or the <i>Wiener Mode</i>, generally not
in the best of humour.</p>

<p>Daniel confidently believed that all this would change for the
better as soon as the child had been born; he believed that the
feeling of a mother and the duties of a mother would have a
broadening and subduing effect on her.</p>

<p>Late in the autumn Dorothea gave birth to a boy, who was
baptised Gottfried. She could not do enough by way of showing
her affection for the child; her transports were expressed in the
most childish terms; her display of tenderness was almost excessive.</p>

<p>For six days she nursed the child herself. Then the novelty
wore off, friends told her it would ruin her shape to keep it up,
and she quit. &#8220;It makes you stout,&#8221; she said to Philippina, &#8220;and
cow&#8217;s milk is just as good, if not better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina opened her mouth and eyes as wide as she could when
she saw Dorothea standing before the mirror, stripped to the hips,
studying the symmetry of her body with a seriousness that no one
had ever noticed in her before.</p>

<p>Dorothea became coldly indifferent toward her child; it seemed
that she had entirely forgotten that she was a mother. The baby
slept in the room with Philippina and Agnes, both of whom cared
for it. Its mother was otherwise engaged.</p>

<p>As if to make up for lost time and to indemnify herself for the
suffering and general inconvenience to which she had been put in
the last few months, Dorothea rushed with mad greediness into
new pleasures and strange diversions. Soon however she found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>herself embarrassed from a lack of funds. Daniel told her, kindly
but firmly, that the salaries he was drawing as organist and teacher
were just barely enough to keep the house going, and that he was
curtailing his own personal needs as much as possible so that there
would be no cause to discontinue or diminish the home comforts
they had latterly been enjoying. &#8220;We are not peasants,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and that we are not living from the mercy of chance is a flaw
in me rather than in my favour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You old pinch-penny!&#8221; said Dorothea. Ugly wrinkles appeared
on her brow. &#8220;If you had not made me disgusted with my
art, I might have been able to make a little money too,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>He looked down at the floor in complete silence. She however
began thinking about ways and means of getting her hands on
money. &#8220;Uncle Carovius might help me,&#8221; she thought. She took
to visiting her father more frequently, and every time she came
she would stand out in the hall for a while hoping to see Herr
Carovius. One day he appeared. She wanted to speak to him,
smile at him, win him over. But one look from that face, filled
with petrified and ineradicable rage, showed her that any attempt
to approach the old man and get him in a friendly frame of mind
would be fruitless.</p>

<p>On the way home she chanced to meet the actor Edmund Hahn.
She had not seen him since she had been married. The actor
seemed tremendously pleased to see her. They walked along together,
engaged in a zealous conversation, talking at first loudly
and then gently.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>The day Dorothea got married, Herr Carovius had gone to his
lawyer to have the will he had drawn up the night before attested
to. He had bequeathed his entire fortune, including his home
and the furniture, to an institution to be erected after his death for
the benefit of orphans of noble birth. Baron Eberhard von
Auffenberg had been named as first director of the institution and
sole executor of his will.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius refused to have anything more to do with music.
He had a leather cover made for his long, narrow grand piano,
and enshrouded in this, the instrument resembled a stuffed animal.
He looked back on his passion for music as one of the aberrations
of his youth, though he realised that he was chastising his spirit
till it hurt when he took this attitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p><p>The method he employed to keep from having nothing to do was
characteristic of the man: he went through all the books of his
library looking for typographical errors. He spent hours every
day at this work; he read the scientific treatises and the volumes of
pure literature with his attention fixed on individual letters. When,
after infinite search, he discovered a word that had been misspelled,
or a grammatical slip, he felt like a fisherman who, after
waiting long and patiently, finally sees a fish dangling on the hook.</p>

<p>Otherwise he was thoroughly unhappy. The beautiful evenness
of his hair on the back of his neck had been transformed into a
shaggy wilderness. He could be seen going along the street in a
suit of clothes that was peppered with spots, while his Calabrian
hat resembled a war tent that has gone through a number of major
offensives.</p>

<p>He had again taken to frequenting the Paradise Caf&eacute; two or
three times a week, not exactly to surrender himself to mournful
memories, but because the coffee there cost twenty pfennigs,
whereas the more modern caf&eacute;s were charging twenty-five. His
dinner consisted of a pot of coffee and a few rolls.</p>

<p>It came about that old Jordan likewise began to frequent the
Paradise. For a long while the two men would go there, sit down
at their chosen tables, and study each other at a distance. Finally
the day came when they sat down together; then it became a
custom for them to take their places at the same table, one back
in the corner by the stove, where a quiet comradeship developed
between them. It was rare that their conversation went beyond
external platitudes.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius acted as though he were merely enduring old
Jordan. But he never really became absorbed in his newspaper
until the old man had come and sat down at the table with him,
greeting him with marked respect as he did so. Jordan, however,
did not conceal his delight when, on entering the caf&eacute; and casting
his eyes around the room, they at last fell on Herr Carovius.
While he sipped his coffee, he never took them off the wicked
face of his <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Philippina became Dorothea&#8217;s confidential friend.</p>

<p>At first it was nothing more than Dorothea&#8217;s desire to gossip that
drew her to Philippina. Later she fell into the habit of telling
her everything she knew. She felt no need of keeping any secret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>from Philippina, the inexplicable. The calm attentiveness with
which Philippina listened to her flattered her, and left her without
a vestige of suspicion. She felt that Philippina was too stupid
and uncultivated to view her activities in perspective or pass judgment
on them.</p>

<p>She liked to conjure up seductive pictures before the old maid&#8217;s
imagination; for she loved to hear Philippina abuse the male of the
species. If some bold plan were maturing in her mind, she would
tell Philippina about it just as if it had already been executed.
In this way she tested the possibility of really carrying out her
designs, and procured for herself a foretaste of what was to follow.</p>

<p>It was chiefly Philippina&#8217;s utter ugliness that made her trust her.
Such a homely creature was in her eyes not a woman, hardly a
human being of either sex; and with her she felt she could talk
just as much as she pleased, and say anything that came into her
head. And since Philippina never spoke of Daniel in any but a
derogatory and spiteful tone, Dorothea felt perfectly safe on that
ground.</p>

<p>She would come into the kitchen, and sit down on a bench and
talk: about a silk dress she had seen for sale; about the fine compliments
Court Councillor Finkeldey had paid her; about the love
affairs of these and the divorce proceedings of those; about Frau
Feistelmann&#8217;s pearls, remarking that she would give ten years of
her life if she also had such pearls. In fact, the word she used
most frequently was &#8220;also.&#8221; She trembled and shook from head to
foot with desires and wishes, low-minded unrest and lusts that
flourish in the dark.</p>

<p>Often she would tell stories of her life in Munich. She told
how she once spent a night with an artist in his studio, just for
fun; and how on another occasion she had gone with an officer to
the barracks at night simply on a wager. She told of all the
fine-looking men who ran after her, and how she dropped them
whenever she felt like it. She said she would let them kiss her
sometimes, but that was all; or she would walk arm in arm with
them through the forest, but that was all. She commented on the
fact that in Munich you had to keep an eye out for the police and
observe their hours, otherwise there might be trouble. For example,
a swarthy Italian kept following her once&mdash;he was a regular
Conte&mdash;and she couldn&#8217;t make the man go on about his business, and
you know he rushed into her room and held a revolver before her
face, and she screamed, of course she did, until the whole house
was awake, and there was an awful excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p><p>When Daniel endeavoured to put a stop to her wastefulness, she
went to Philippina and complained. Philippina encouraged her.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you let him get away with anything,&#8221; said she, &#8220;let him
feel that a woman with your beauty didn&#8217;t have to marry a skinflint.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she began to go with Edmund Hahn, she told Philippina
all about it. &#8220;You ought to see him, Philippina,&#8221; she whispered in
a mysterious way. &#8220;He is a regular Don Juan; he can turn the head
of any woman.&#8221; She said he had been madly in love with her for
two years, and now he was going to gamble for her; but in a very
aristocratic and exclusive club, to which none but the nicest people
belonged. &#8220;If I win, Philippina, I am going to make you a lovely
present,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>From then on her conversation became rather tangled and incoherent.
She was out a great deal, and when she returned she was
always in a rather uncertain condition. She had Philippina put
up her hair, and every word she spoke during the operation was
a lie. One time she confessed that she had not been in the theatre,
as Daniel had supposed, but at the house of a certain Frau B&auml;umler,
a good friend of Edmund Hahn. They had been gambling: she
had won sixty marks. She looked at the door as if in fear, took out
her purse, and showed Philippina three gold pieces.</p>

<p>Philippina had to swear that she would not give Dorothea away.
A few days later Dorothea got into another party and got out of it
successfully, and Philippina had to renew her oath. The old maid
could take an oath with an ease and glibness such as she might
have displayed in saying good morning. In the bottom of her heart
she never failed to grant herself absolution for the perjury she was
committing. For the time being she wished to collect, take notes,
follow the game wherever it went. Moreover, it tickled and
satisfied her senses to think about relations and situations which she
knew full well she could never herself experience.</p>

<p>Dorothea became more and more ensnared. Her eyes looked
like will-o&#8217;-the-wisps, her laugh was jerky and convulsive. She
never had time, either for her husband or her child. She would
receive letters occasionally that she would read with greedy haste
and then tear into shreds. Philippina came into her room once
quite suddenly; Dorothea, terrified, hid a photograph she had been
holding in her hand. When Philippina became indignant at the
secrecy of her action, she said with an air of inoffensive superiority:
&#8220;You would not understand it, Philippina. That is something I
cannot discuss with any one.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p><p>But Philippina&#8217;s vexation worried her: she showed her the photograph.
It was the picture of a young man with a cold, crusty face.
Dorothea said it was an American whom she had met at Frau
B&auml;umler&#8217;s. He was said to be very rich and alone.</p>

<p>Every evening Philippina wanted to know something about the
American. &#8220;Tell me about the American,&#8221; she would say.</p>

<p>One evening, quite late, Dorothea came into Philippina&#8217;s room
with nothing on but her night-gown. Agnes and little Gottfried
were asleep. &#8220;The American has a box at the theatre to-morrow
evening. If you call for me you can see him,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am bursting with curiosity,&#8221; replied Philippina.</p>

<p>For a while Dorothea sat in perfect silence, and then exclaimed:
&#8220;If I only had money, Philippin&#8217;, if I only had money!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought the American had piles of it,&#8221; replied Philippina.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he has money, lots of it,&#8221; said Dorothea, and her
eyes flashed, &#8220;but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think men do things without being compensated?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s it,&#8221; said Philippina reflectively, &#8220;that&#8217;s it.&#8221; She
crouched on a hassock at Dorothea&#8217;s feet. &#8220;How pretty you are,
how sweet,&#8221; she said in her bass voice: &#8220;God, what pretty little
feet you have! And what smooth white skin! Marble&#8217;s got
nothing on you.&#8221; And with the carnal concupiscence of a faun in
woman&#8217;s form she took Dorothea&#8217;s leg in her hand and stroked the
skin as far as the knee.</p>

<p>Dorothea shuddered. As she looked down at the cowering
Philippina, she noticed that there was a button missing on her
blouse. Through the opening, just between her breasts, she saw
something brown. &#8220;What is that on your body there?&#8221; asked
Dorothea.</p>

<p>Philippina blushed. &#8220;Nothing for you,&#8221; she replied in a rough
tone, and held her hand over the opening in her blouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Philippina, tell me,&#8221; begged Dorothea, who could not
stand the thought of any one keeping a secret from her: &#8220;Possibly
it is your dowry. Possibly you have made a savings bank out of
your bosom?&#8221; She laughed lustily.</p>

<p>Philippina got up: &#8220;Yes, it is my money,&#8221; she confessed with
reluctance, and looked at Dorothea hostilely.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be a whole lot. Look out, or some one will steal it
from you. You will have to sleep on your stomach.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel came down from his study, and heard Dorothea laughing.
Grief was gnawing at his heart; he passed hastily by the door.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p><h3>XI</h3>

<p>One evening, as Philippina came into the hall from the street,
she saw a man coming up to her in the dark; he called her by
name. She thought she recognised his voice, and on looking at him
more closely saw that it was her father.</p>

<p>She had not spoken to him for ten years. She had seen him
from time to time at a distance, but she had always made it a point
to be going in another direction as soon as she saw him; she
avoided him, absolutely.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the news?&#8221; she asked in a friendly tone.</p>

<p>Jason Philip cleared his throat, and tried to get out of the light
in the hall and back into the shadow: he wished to conceal his
shabby clothes from his daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, listen,&#8221; he began with affected naturalness, &#8220;you might
inquire about your parents once in a while. The few steps over to
our house wouldn&#8217;t make you break your legs. Honour thy father
and thy mother, you know. Your mother deserves any kindness you
can show her. As for me, well, I have dressed you down at times,
but only when you needed it. You were a mischievous monkey,
and you know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed; but there was the fire of fear in his eyes. Philippina
was the embodiment of silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I was saying,&#8221; Jason Philip continued hastily, as if to
prevent any inimical memories of his daughter from coming to his
mind, &#8220;you might pay a little attention to your parents once in a
while: Can&#8217;t you lend me ten marks? I have got to meet a bill
to-morrow morning, and I haven&#8217;t got a pfennig. The boys, you
know, I mean your brothers, are conducting themselves splendidly.
They give me something the first of each month, and they do it
regularly. But I don&#8217;t like to go to them about this piddling
business to-morrow. I thought that as you were right here in the
neighbourhood, I could come over and see you about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jason Philip was lying. His sons gave him no help whatsoever.
Willibald was living in Breslau, where he had a poorly paid position
as a bookkeeper and was just barely making ends meet. Markus
was good for nothing, and head over heels in debt.</p>

<p>Philippina thought the matter over for a moment, and then told
her father to wait. She went upstairs. Jason Philip waited at the
door, whistling softly. Many years had passed by since he first
attacked the civil powers, urged on by a rebellion of noble thoughts
in his soul. Many years had passed by since he had made his peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>with these same civil powers. Nevertheless, he continued to whistle
the &#8220;Marseillaise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina came waddling down the steps, dragged herself over
to the door, and gave her father a five-mark piece. &#8220;There,&#8221; she
bellowed, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t any more myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jason Philip was satisfied with half the amount he had asked
for. He was now equipped for an onslaught on the nearest caf&eacute;
with its corned beef, sausages, and new beer.</p>

<p>From this time on he came around to the house on &AElig;gydius
Place quite frequently. He would stand in the hall, look around
for Philippina, and if he found her, beg her for money. The
amounts Philippina gave him became smaller and smaller. Finally
she took to giving him ten pfennigs when he came.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>It frequently happened that Daniel would not answer when any
one asked him a question. His ear lost the words, his eye the
pictures, signs, faces, gestures. He was in his own way; he was
a torment to himself.</p>

<p>Something drew him there and then here. He would leave the
house, and then be taken with a longing to return. He noticed
that people were laughing at him; laughing at him behind his
back. He read mockery in the eyes of his pupils; the maids in the
house tittered when he passed by.</p>

<p>What did they know? What were they concealing? Perhaps
his soul could have told what they knew and what they concealed;
but he was unwilling to drag it all out into the realm of known,
nameable things.</p>

<p>As if an invisible slanderer were at his side, unwilling to leave
him, leave him in peace, his despair increased. &#8220;What have you
done, Daniel!&#8221; a voice within him cried, &#8220;what have you done!&#8221;
The shades of the sisters, arm in arm, arose before him.</p>

<p>The feeling of having made a mistake, a mistake that could
never be rectified, burned like fire within him. His work, so
nearly completed, had suddenly died away.</p>

<p>For the sake of his symphony, he forced himself into a quiet
frame of mind at night, made room for faint-hearted hopes, and
lulled his presentient soul into peace.</p>

<p>The thing that troubled him worst of all was the way Philippina
looked at him.</p>

<p>Since the birth of the child he had been living in Eleanore&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>room. Old Jordan was consideration itself: he went around in
his stocking feet so as not to disturb him.</p>

<p>One night Daniel took the candle, and went downstairs to
Dorothea&#8217;s room. She woke up, screamed, looked at him bewildered,
recognised him, became indignant, and then laughed mockingly
and sensually.</p>

<p>He sat down on the side of her bed, and took her right hand
between his two. But he had a disagreeable sensation on feeling
her hand in his, and looked at her fingers. They were not
finely formed: they were thicker at the ends than in the middle;
they could not remain quiet; they twitched constantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;This can&#8217;t keep up, Dorothea,&#8221; he said in a kindly tone, &#8220;you
are ruining your own life and mine too. Why do you have all
these people around you? Is the pleasure you derive from associating
with them so great that it benumbs your conscience? I
have no idea what you are doing. Tell me about it. The household
affairs are in a wretched condition; everything is in disorder.
And that cigar smoke out in the living room! I opened
a window. And your child! It has no mother. Look at its little
face, and see how pale and sickly it looks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t help it; Philippina puts poppy in the milk so
that it will sleep longer,&#8221; Dorothea answered, after the fashion
of guilty women: of the various reproaches Daniel had cast at her,
she seized upon the one of which she felt the least guilty. But
after this, Daniel had no more to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so tired and sleepy,&#8221; said Dorothea, and again blinked at
him out of one corner of her eye with that mocking, sensual look.
As he showed no inclination to leave, she yawned, and continued
in an angry tone: &#8220;Why do you wake a person up in the middle of
the night, if all you want is to scold them? Get out of here, you
loathsome thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her back on him, and rested her head on her hand.
Opposite her bed was a mirror in a gold frame. She saw herself
in it; she was pleased with herself lying there in that offended
mood, and she smiled.</p>

<p>Daniel, who had been so cruel to noble women now become
shades, saw how she smiled at herself, infatuated with herself: he
took pity on such child-like vanity.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a Chinese fairy tale about a Princess,&#8221; he said, and
bent down over Dorothea, &#8220;who received from her mother as a
wedding present a set of jewel boxes. There was a costly present
in each box, but the last, smallest, innermost one was locked, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>the Princess had to promise that she would never open it. She
kept her promise for a while, but curiosity at last got the better
of her, she forgot her vow, and opened the last little box by force.
There was a mirror in it; and when she looked into it and saw how
beautiful she was, she began to abuse her husband. She tortured
him so that he killed her one day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea looked at him terrified. Then she laughed and said:
&#8220;What a stupid story! Such a tale of horror!&#8221; She laid her
cheek on the pillow, and again looked in the mirror.</p>

<p>The following morning Daniel received an anonymous letter.
It read as follows: &#8220;You will be guarding your own honour if you
keep a sharp lookout on your wife. A Well-wisher.&#8221;</p>

<p>A cold fever came over him. For a few days he dragged his
body from room to room as if poisoned. He avoided every one in
the house. One night he again felt a desire to go down to Dorothea.
When he reached the door to her room, he found it bolted.
He knocked, but received no answer. He knocked again, this time
more vigorously. He heard her turn her head on the pillow. &#8220;Let
me sleep!&#8221; cried Dorothea angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door, Dorothea,&#8221; he begged.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I will not; I want to sleep.&#8221; These were the words that
reached his ear from behind the bolted door.</p>

<p>He pressed three or four times on the latch, implored her
three or four times to let him come in, but received no answer.
He did not wish to make any more noise, looked straight ahead
as if into a dark hole, and then turned and went back to his room
in the attic.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Friedrich Benda was again in Europe. All the newspapers contained
accounts of the discoveries made on the expedition. Last
autumn Arab dealers in ivory had found him in the land of Niam-Niam,
taken an interest in him, and finally brought him, then
seemingly in the throes of imminent death, back to the Nile. In
England he was celebrated as a hero and a bold pioneer; the Royal
Geographical Society had made him an honorary member; and the
incidents of his journey were the talk of the day.</p>

<p>Toward the close of April he came to Nuremberg to visit his
mother. The blind old woman had been carefully and cautiously
prepared for his coming. She nevertheless came very near dying
with joy; her life was in grave danger for a while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p><p>Benda had not wished to stay more than a week: his business
and his work called him back to London; he had lectures to deliver,
and he had to see a book through the press, a book in which he had
given a description of the years spent in Africa.</p>

<p>At the urgent request of his mother he had decided to stay
longer. Moreover, during the first days of his visit to Nuremberg,
he suffered from a severe attack of a fever he had brought with him
from the tropics, and this forced him to remain in bed. The
news of his presence in the city finally became generally known,
and he was annoyed by the curiosity of many people who had
formerly never concerned themselves about him in the slightest.</p>

<p>He was eager to see Daniel; every hour of delay in meeting his
old friend was an hour of reproach. But his mother insisted that
he stay with her; he had to sit near her and tell of his experiences
in Africa.</p>

<p>When he heard of the outer events in Daniel&#8217;s life he was filled
with terror. The fact that made the profoundest impression on
him was Daniel&#8217;s marriage to Dorothea D&ouml;derlein. People told
him a great many things about their life and how they were getting
along, and with each passing day he felt that it would be more
difficult to go to Daniel. One evening he got his courage together
and decided to go. He got as far as &AElig;gydius Place, when he was
seized with such a feeling of sadness and discomfort at the thought
of all the changes that time and fate had made that he turned back.
He felt as if he might be deceived by a picture which would perhaps
still show the features of Daniel as he looked in former years,
but that he would be so changed inwardly that words would be
unable to bring the two together.</p>

<p>He longed to talk with some one who loved Daniel and who had
followed his career with pure motives. He had to think for a long
while: where was there such a person? He thought of old Herold
and went to him. He directed the conversation without digression
to a point that was of prime importance to him. And in order to
put the old man in as confidential a frame of mind as possible, he
reminded him of a night when the three of them, Daniel, Herold,
and Benda, had sat in the Mohren Cellar drinking wine and discussing
things in general, important and unimportant, that have a
direct bearing on life.</p>

<p>The old man nodded; he recalled the evening. He spoke of
Daniel&#8217;s genius with a modesty and a deference that made Benda&#8217;s
heart swell. He raised his finger, and said with a fine fire in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>eye: &#8220;I&#8217;ll stand good for him. I prophesy on the word of the
Bible: A star will rise from Jacob.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he spoke of Eleanore; he was passionately fond of her.
He told how she had brought him the quartette, and how she had
glowed with inspiration and the desire to help. He also had a good
deal to say about Gertrude, especially with regard to her mental
breakdown and her death.</p>

<p>Benda left the old man at once quiet and disquieted. He
walked along the street for a long while, rapt in thought. When
he looked up he saw that he was standing before Daniel&#8217;s house.
He went in.</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>Daniel knew that Benda had returned: Philippina had read it
in the newspaper and told him about it. Dorothea, who had
learned of his return from her father, had also spoken to him
about it. He had also heard other people speak of it.</p>

<p>The first time he heard it he was startled. He felt he would
have to flee to his friend of former days. Then he was seized
with the same fear that had come over Benda: Is our relation to each
other the same? The thought of meeting Benda filled him with a
sense of shame, to which was added a touch of bitterness as day
after day passed by and Benda never called or wrote. &#8220;It is all
over,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;he has forgotten me.&#8221; He would have liked to
forget too; and he could have done it, for his mind was wandering,
restless, strayed.</p>

<p>One evening as he crossed the square he noticed that the windows
of his house were all brilliantly lighted. He went to the
kitchen, where he found Agnes at the table seeding plums.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is here again?&#8221; he asked. One could hear laughter, loud
and boisterous, in the living room.</p>

<p>Agnes, scarcely looking up, reeled off the names: Councillor
Finkeldey, Herr von Ginsterberg, Herr Samuelsky, Herr Hahn, a
strange man whose name she did not know, Frau Feistelmann and
her sister.</p>

<p>Daniel remained silent for a while. Then he went up to
Agnes, put his hand under her chin, lifted her head, and murmured:
&#8220;And you? And you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Agnes frowned, and was afraid to look into his face. Suddenly
she said: &#8220;To-day is the anniversary of mother&#8217;s death.&#8221; With
that she looked at him fixedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;So?&#8221; said Daniel, sat down on the edge of the table, and
laid his head in his hand. Some one was playing the piano in the
living room. Since Daniel had taken the grand piano up to his
room, Dorothea had rented a small one. The rhythmical movement
of dancing couples could be heard quite distinctly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to leave this place,&#8221; said Agnes, as she threw a worm-eaten
plum in the garbage can. &#8220;In Beckschlager Street there is a
seamstress who wants to teach me to sew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go?&#8221; asked Daniel. &#8220;It would be a very sensible
thing to do. But what will Philippina say about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she doesn&#8217;t object, provided I spend my evenings and
Sundays with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The front door bell rang, and Agnes went out: there was some
one to see Daniel. He hesitated, started toward the door, shook
and stepped back, seized with trembling hand the kitchen lamp in
order to make certain that he was not mistaken, for it was dark,
but there could be no mistake. It was Benda.</p>

<p>They looked at each other in violent agitation. Benda was the
first to reach out his hand; then Daniel reached out his. Something
seemed to snap within him. He became dizzy, his tall, stiff body
swung back and forth. Then he fell into the arms of his friend,
whom he had lived without for seventeen years.</p>

<p>Benda was not prepared for such a scene; he was unable to
speak. Then Daniel tore himself loose from the embrace of his
old comrade, pushed the dishevelled hair back from his forehead,
and said hastily: &#8220;Come upstairs with me; no one will disturb us
up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel lighted the lamp in his room, and then looked around to
see whether old Jordan was at home. Jordan&#8217;s room was dark.
He closed the door and took a seat opposite Benda. He was breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>What meaning can be attached to the preliminary questions and
answers that invariably accompany such a meeting after such a long
separation? &#8220;How are you? How long are you going to stay in
town? You still have the same old habits of life? Tell me about
yourself.&#8221; What do such questions mean? They mean virtually
nothing. The protagonists thereby simply remove the rubbish from
the channels which have been choked up in the course of years, and
try to build new bridges carrying them over abysses that must be
crossed if the conversation is to be connected and coherent.</p>

<p>Benda had grown somewhat stout. His face was brownish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>yellow, about the colour of leather. The deep wrinkles around his
forehead and mouth told of the hardships he had gone through.
His eye was completely changed: it had the strong, vivacious, and
yet quiet appearance of the eye of a hunter or a peasant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may well imagine that I have already told the story of my
adventures in Africa a hundred times and in the same way,&#8221; said
Benda. &#8220;It has all been written down, and will shortly appear in
book form, where you can read it. It was an unbroken chain of toil
and trouble. Frequently I was as close to death as I am to this wall.
I devoured enough quinine to fill a freight car, and yet it was
always the same old story, fever to-day, to-morrow, for six months
in the year. I have, I fear, ruined my health; I am afraid my
old heart will not last much longer. The eternal vigilance I was
obliged to exercise, the incessant fight for so simple a thing as a
path, or for more urgent things such as food and drink, has told
on me. I suffered terribly from the sun; also from the rain. I
had very few of the comforts of life; I was often forced to sleep
on the ground. And there was no one to talk to, no sense of
security.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I had my reward. When I look
back on it all, there is not an hour that I would care to have wiped
from my memory. I accomplished a great deal. I made some important
discoveries, brought back enough work to keep me busy for
years to come, thirty-six boxes of plant preparations, and this despite
the fact that the entire fruit of my first seven years of effort was
burned in a tent near Nembos. But apart from what I have actually
done, there is something so real and solemn about such a life.
You live with the sky above you and savages round about you.
These savages are like children. This state of affairs is, to be sure,
being rapidly changed: Europe is breathing its pest into the paradise.
The wiles and weaknesses of these savages are in a way
touching; you feel sorry for them as you feel sorry for a dumb,
harassed beast. I had taken a boy along with me from the boundless,
primeval forests north of the Congo. He was a little bit of
a fellow, almost a dwarf. I liked him; I even loved him. And
obedient! I merely had to make a sign, and he was ready. Well,
we came back to the Italian lakes, where I wished to remain for
a while for the sake of the climate before returning to England.
What happened? At the sight of the snow-covered mountain peaks
he was seized with deathly fear; he became homesick; and in a few
days he died of pneumonia.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;Why is it that there was such a long period that we never heard
from you?&#8221; asked Daniel, with a timidity and shyness that made
Benda&#8217;s heart ache.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a long story,&#8221; said Benda. &#8220;It took me two years to
get through that fearful forest and out to a lake called Albert-Nyanza.
From there I wanted to get over to Egypt, but the country
was in a state of revolution and was occupied by the soldiers
of the Mahdi. I was forced to take the route to the Northwest,
ran into a pathless wilderness, and for five years was a captive of
a tribe of the Wadai. The Niam-Niam, who were at war with the
Wadai, liberated me. I could move about with relative freedom
among them, but I could not go beyond their boundaries, for they
held me in high esteem as a medicine man and were afraid I would
bewitch them if I ever got out of their personal control. I had
lost my guides, and I had no money to hire new ones. The things
I needed, because of the delicacy of my constitution, as compared
with theirs, I secured through the chieftain from a band of
Arabian merchants. This was all very well so far as it went, but
the chieftain was careful to keep me concealed from the Arabs.
I finally succeeded in coming into personal touch with a Sheik to
whom I could make myself understood. It was high time, for I
could not have stood it another year.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel was silent. It was all so strange; he could hardly adapt
himself to Benda&#8217;s voice and manner. Memory failed him. The
world of Benda was all too foreign, unknown to him. What he
himself felt had no weight with his friend; it did not even have
meaning. With the old sense of dim defiance, he coaxed
the ghost of disappointment into his soul; and his soul was
weighed down by the nocturnal darkness like the glass of his
window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I am enjoying my home,&#8221; said Benda thoughtfully, &#8220;I
am enjoying a milder light, a more ordered civilisation. I have
come to look upon Germany as a definite figure, to love it as a
composite picture. Nature, really great, grand nature such as
formerly seemed beyond the reach of my longings, such as constituted
my idea, my presentiment of perfection, I have experienced
in person; I have lived it. It enticed me, taught me, and
almost destroyed me. All human organisation, on the contrary, has
developed more and more into an idea. In hours that were as full
of the feeling of things as the heart is full of blood, I have seen
the scales of the balance move up and down with the weight of
two worlds. The loneliness, the night, the heavens at night, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>forest, the desert have shown me their true faces. The terribleness
that at times proceeds from them has no equal in any other
condition of existence. I understood for the first time the law
that binds families, peoples, states together. I have repudiated all
thought of rebellion, and sworn to co-operate, to do nothing but
co-operate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to make a confession to you,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I never
had the faintest conception of the rhythm of life until I went to
Africa. I had known how long it takes to grow a tree; I was
familiar with the metamorphoses through which a plant must
pass before it attains to perfection and becomes what it is; but it
had never occurred to me to apply these laws and facts to our own
lives; this had never entered my mind. I had demanded too
much; I had been in too much of a hurry. Egoistic impatience had
placed false weights and measures in my hands. What I have
learned during these seventeen years of trial and hardship is patience.
Everything moves so slowly. Humanity is still a child,
and yet we demand justice of it, expect right and righteous action
from it. Justice? Oh, there is still a long, long road to be travelled
before we reach Justice! The way is as long and arduous as
that from the primeval forest to the cultivated garden. We must
exercise patience&mdash;for the benefit of the many generations of men
that are to come after us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel got up and began to walk back and forth. After a
silence that was exceedingly painful to Benda, he said: &#8220;Let&#8217;s go
out. Let&#8217;s go to a caf&eacute;, or take a long walk on the streets, or go
wherever you would like to go. Or if I am a burden to you, I
will accompany you for a short stretch and then remain alone.
The point is, I cannot stay here any longer; I cannot stand it
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A burden to me?&#8221; replied Benda reproachfully. That was the
tone, the look of years gone by. Daniel felt at once that he was
personally under no obligation to talk. He saw at once that Benda
knew a great deal and suspected the rest. He felt his heart grow
lighter.</p>

<p>They went downstairs.</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>Daniel asked Benda to wait on the stairs, locked the door, and
took his hat from the hook. In the living room there was a great
deal of noise punctuated with laughter. Philippina came out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>her room, and snarled: &#8220;The way they&#8217;re carrying on in there!
You&#8217;d think they wuz all drunk!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is going on?&#8221; asked Daniel timidly, merely to have
something to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are playing blindfold,&#8221; replied Philippina contemptuously,
&#8220;every one of them is an old bird, and they&#8217;re playing
blindfold!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sound as if a plate had been broken; a piercing
scream followed, and then silence. But the silence was of momentary
duration: that vulgar, slimy laughter soon broke out again.</p>

<p>Above the din of screaming voices, Daniel heard Dorothea&#8217;s.
He hastened to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>His enraged eye fell on the table covered with pots, empty
cups, and pastry. The chairs had been pushed to one side; the new
gas chandelier with its five frosted globes was functioning at full
force; there were seven or eight persons grouped around Dorothea,
laughing and looking at something that had fallen on the floor.</p>

<p>Dorothea had pushed the white sash she had been wearing while
playing blindfold back on her forehead. She was the first to see
Daniel; she exclaimed: &#8220;There is my husband. Now don&#8217;t get
angry, Daniel; it&#8217;s nothing but that idiotic plaster mask.&#8221;</p>

<p>Councillor Finkeldey, a white-bearded man, nodded at Daniel,
or at least at the spot where he was standing, with marked enthusiasm.
It was his way of paying homage to Dorothea: everything
she said he accompanied with an inspired nod of approval.</p>

<p>Daniel saw that the mask of Zingarella had been broken to
pieces.</p>

<p>Without greeting a single person present, without even looking
at a single one of them, he stepped into the circle, knelt down,
and tried to put the broken pieces of the mask together. But
there were too many small shreds. The nose, the chin, parts of
the glorious forehead, a piece with the mouth arched in sorrow,
another piece of the cheek&mdash;there were too many; they could not
be put together.</p>

<p>He hurled the fragments to one side, and straightened up.
&#8220;Philippina! The broom!&#8221; His command was given in a loud
tone. And when Philippina came in with the broom, he added:
&#8220;Sweep the dirt up on a pile, and then throw it in the garbage
can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina swept up, while Daniel, as silent and unsocial on
going as he had been on coming, left the room.</p>

<p>Frau Feistelmann made an indignant face, Edward Hahn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>breathed through his nose, Herr Samuelsky, a fat man with a red
beard, made a contemptuous remark, Dorothea, vexed and annoyed,
stood and looked on while the tears took their unrestrained
course.</p>

<p>Benda had been waiting down at the front door. &#8220;She has
broken my mask,&#8221; said Daniel with a distorted smile, as he came
down to his old friend, &#8220;the mask you gave me. You remember!
Strange that it should have been broken to-day of all days, the
very day you come to see me after so long a separation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly it can be glued together again,&#8221; said Benda, trying to
console Daniel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not in favour of glueing things together,&#8221; replied Daniel.
His eyes flashed green behind his glasses.</p>


<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>When the guests left, Philippina came in and cleaned up the
room. Dorothea sat on the sofa. Her hands were lying in her
lap; she was unusually serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t your American ever come to see us?&#8221; asked Philippina,
without apparent motive.</p>

<p>Dorothea was terrified. &#8220;Lock the door, Philippina,&#8221; she whispered,
&#8220;I have something to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina locked the door, and went over to the sofa. &#8220;The
American has to see me,&#8221; continued Dorothea, as her eyes roamed
about the room in timid waywardness. &#8220;He says he wants to talk to
me about something that will be of very great importance to me
the rest of my life. He is living in a hotel, but I can&#8217;t go to a
hotel. It will not do to have him come here, nor do I wish to
be seen on the street with him. He has suggested a place where
we might meet, but I am afraid: I do not know the people. Can&#8217;t
you help me out, Philippina? Don&#8217;t you know some one to whom
we can go and in whose house we can meet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippina&#8217;s eyes shone with their veteran glitter. She thought
for a second or two, and then replied: &#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;ll tell you what
you can do. Go down to Frau Hadebusch&#8217;s! She&#8217;s a good
friend of mine, and you c&#8217;n depend on her. It don&#8217;t make no
difference what takes place in her house; it won&#8217;t bother even the
cat. You know Frau Hadebusch! Of course you do. What am
I talking about! She is a widow, and lives all alone in a little
house. She won&#8217;t rent; she says she don&#8217;t want the trouble. You
know she&#8217;s no young woman any more. She is all alone, mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>you. No one there but her son, and he&#8217;s cracked. Honest, the
boy ain&#8217;t right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you go and talk it over with Frau Hadebusch, Philippina,&#8221;
said Dorothea timidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I&#8217;ll go see her to-morrow morning,&#8221; replied Philippina,
smiled subserviently, and laid her horny hand on Dorothea&#8217;s
tender shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;But listen, Philippina, be very, very careful. Do you hear?&#8221;
Dorothea&#8217;s eyes became big and threatening. &#8220;Swear that you will
be as silent as the tombs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As true as I&#8217;m standing here!&#8221; said Philippina. Just then she
bent over to pick up a hair pin from the floor.</p>

<p>The next morning Philippina ran over to Frau Hadebusch&#8217;s.
The whole way she kept humming to herself; she was happy; she
was contented.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Despite</span> the rain, Daniel and Benda strolled around the city
moat until midnight.</p>

<p>The very thing that lay heaviest on Daniel&#8217;s heart, as was obvious
from the expression on his face, he never mentioned. He
told of his work, his travels in connection with the old manuscripts,
his position as organist and in the conservatory, but all in
such a general, detached, and distraught way, so tired and bewildered,
that Benda was filled with an embarrassed anguish that made
courteous attention difficult if not impossible.</p>

<p>In order to get him to talk more freely, Benda remarked that he
had not heard of the death of Gertrude and Eleanore until his
return. He said he was terribly pained to hear of it, and, try as
he might, he could not help but brood over it. But he had no
thought of persuading Daniel to give him the mournful details.
He merely wished to convince himself that Daniel had become
master of the anguish he had gone through,&mdash;master of it at least
inwardly.</p>

<p>Instead of making a direct and logical reply, Daniel said with
a twitching of his lips: &#8220;Yes, I know, you have been here for quite
a while already. Inwardly I was surprised at your silence. But it
is not easy to start up a renewed friendship with such a problematic
creature as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know you are wrong when you say that,&#8221; responded Benda
calmly, &#8220;and therefore I refuse to explain my long waiting. You
never were problematic to me, nor are you now. I find you at
this moment just as true and whole as you always were, despite the
fact that you avoid me, crouch before me, barricade yourself
against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel&#8217;s breast heaved as if in the throes of a convulsion. He
said falteringly: &#8220;First let that old confidence return and grow. I
must first become accustomed to the thought that there is a man
near me who feels with me, sympathises with me, understands me.
To be sure, you want me to talk. But I cannot talk, at least not
of those things about which you would like to hear. I am afraid:
I shudder at the thought; I have forgotten how; words mock me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>make me feel ashamed. Even when I have good dreams, I personally
am as happily and blessedly silent in them as the beast of the
field. I shudder at the thought of reaching down into my soul
and pulling out old, rusty things and showing them to you&mdash;mouldy
fruit, slag, junk&mdash;showing them to you, you who knew
me when all within me was crystal.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes on the clouds and then continued: &#8220;But there
is probably another means, Friedrich. Look, friend, look! It was
always your affair to look, to behold. Look, but see to it that you
do not make me writhe before you like a worm in the dust! And
when you have looked&mdash;wisdom needs only one spoken word for
ten that are unspoken. This one word you will surely draw from
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benda, deeply moved, remained silent: &#8220;Is it the fault of a
woman?&#8221; he asked gently, as they crossed the drawbridge and
entered the desolate old door leading to the castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fault of a woman? No! Not really the fault of a
woman. It is rather the fault of a man&mdash;my fault. Many a
fate reaches the decisive point in happiness, many not until coloured
with guilt. And guilt is bitter. The fault of a woman!&#8221;
he repeated, in a voice that threw off a gruesome echo in the
vaulted arch of the gateway to the castle. &#8220;There is to be sure a
woman there; and when one has anything to do with her, he finds
himself with nothing left but his eyes for weeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>They left the gateway. Benda laid one hand on Daniel&#8217;s
shoulder, and pointed in silence at the sky with the other. There
were no stars to be seen; nothing but clouds. Benda however had
the stars in mind. Daniel understood his gesture. His eyelids
closed; around his mouth there was an expression of vehement
grief.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Benda was convinced, not merely that one great misfortune had
already taken place, but that a still greater was in the making.</p>

<p>Whenever he thought of Dorothea, the picture that came to his
mind was one that filled him with fear. And yet, he thought,
she must have some remarkable traits, otherwise Daniel would
never have chosen her as his life companion. He wanted to meet
her.</p>

<p>He had Daniel invite him in to tea. He called one evening
early in the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p><p>She received him with expressions of ostentatious joy. She said
she could hardly wait until he came, for there was nothing in the
world that made such an impression on her as a man who had
really run great risks, who had placed his very life at stake. She
could not become tired of asking him questions. At each of his
laconic replies she would shake her head with astonishment. Then
she rested her elbows on her knees, placed her head in her hands,
bent over and stared at him as though he were some kind of prodigy&mdash;or
monster.</p>

<p>She asked him whether he had been among cannibals, whether
he had shot any savages, whether he had hunted lions, and whether
it was really true that every Negro chieftain had hundreds of
wives. When she asked this question she made an insidious face,
and remarked that Europeans would do the same thing if the law
allowed.</p>

<p>Thereupon she said that she could not recall having seen him,
when still a child, in her father&#8217;s house, and she was surprised at
this, for he had such a striking personality. She devoured him
with her eyes; they began to burn as they always did when she
wanted to make some kind of human capture, and blind greed
came over her. She unbent; she spoke in her very sweetest voice;
in her laugh and her smile there was, in fact, something irresistible,
something like that trait we notice in good, confiding, but at
times obstinate children.</p>

<p>But she noticed that this man studied her, not as if she were
a young married woman who were trying to please him and gain
his sympathy, rather as a curious variety of the human species.
There was something in his face that made her tremble with
irritation, and all of a sudden her eyes were filled with hate and
distrust.</p>

<p>Benda felt sorry for her. This everlasting attempt to make a
seductive gesture, this fishing for words that would convey a double
meaning, this self-betrayal, this excitement about nothing, made
him feel sad. Dorothea did not seem to him a bad woman.
Whatever else she might be accused of, it did not seem to
him that she was guilty of downright immoral practices. He
felt that she was merely misguided, poisoned, a phantom and a
fool.</p>

<p>His mind went back to certain Ethiopian women in the very
heart of Africa; he thought of their noble walk, the proud restfulness
of their features, their chaste nudeness, and their inseparability
from the earth and the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p><p>He nevertheless understood his friend: the musician could not
help but succumb to the charms of the phantom; the lonely man
sought the least lonely of all human beings.</p>

<p>As he was coming to this conclusion, Daniel entered the room.
He greeted Benda, and said to Dorothea: &#8220;There is a girl outside
who says she has some ostrich feathers for you. Did you order any
feathers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; replied Dorothea hastily, &#8220;it is a present from my
friend, Emmy B&uuml;ttinger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know her? Why, she is the sister of Frau Feistelmann.
You must help me,&#8221; she said, turning to Benda, &#8220;for you
must know all about this kind of things. There where you have
been ostriches must be as thick as chickens here at home.&#8221; Laughing,
she went out, and returned in due time with a big box, from
which, cautiously and with evident delight, she took two big
feathers, one white, one black. Holding them by the stem, she
laid them across her hair, stepped up to the mirror, and looked
at herself with an intoxicated mien.</p>

<p>In this mien there was something so extraordinary, indeed uncanny,
that Benda could not help but cast a horrified glance at
Daniel.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the first time I ever knew what a mirror was,&#8221; he said
to himself.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>That evening Daniel visited Benda in his home. Benda showed
him some armour and implements he had brought back with him
from Africa. In explaining some of the more unusual objects,
he described at length the customs of the African blacks.</p>

<p>Then he was seized with a headache, sat down in his easy chair,
and was silent for a long while. He suddenly looked like an old
man. The ravages his health had suffered while in the tropics
became visible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see Dorothea&#8217;s mother?&#8221; he asked, by way of
breaking the long silence.</p>

<p>Daniel shook his head: &#8220;It is said that she is vegetating, a mere
shadow of her former self, in some kind of an institution in
Erlangen,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been told that neither Andreas D&ouml;derlein nor his daughter
has ever, in all these years, taken the slightest interest in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>unfortunate woman,&#8221; continued Benda. &#8220;Well, as to Andreas
D&ouml;derlein, I have always known what to expect of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel looked up. &#8220;You hinted once that D&ouml;derlein was guilty
of reprehensible conduct with regard to his wife. Do you recall?
Is that in any way connected with Dorothea and her life? Do
you care to discuss the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no objection whatever to throwing such light on the
incident as I have,&#8221; replied Benda. &#8220;It does have to do with
Dorothea, and it explains, perhaps, some things about her. That
is, it is possible that her character is in part due to the kind of
father she grew up under and the kind of mother she lost when a
mere child. It is strange the way these things work out: I am
myself, in a way, interwoven with your own fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent for a while; memories were rushing to his mind.
Then he began: &#8220;If you had ever known Marguerite D&ouml;derlein,
she would have been just as unforgettable to you as she is to me.
She and Eleanore&mdash;those were the two really musical women I
have known in my life. They were both all nature, all soul.
Marguerite&#8217;s youth was a prison; her brother Carovius was the
jailer. When she married D&ouml;derlein, she somehow fancied she
would escape from that prison, but she merely exchanged one for
the other. And yet she hardly knew how it all came about. She
accepted everything just as it came to her with unwavering fidelity
and gentleness. Her soul remained unlacerated, unembittered.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rested his head on his hand; his voice became gentler. &#8220;We
loved one another before we had ever spoken a word to each
other. We met each other a few times on the street, once in a
while in the park; and a number of times she stole up to me in the
theatre. I was not reserved: I offered her my life, but she always
insisted that she could not live without her child and be happy.
I respected her feelings and restrained my own. For a while
things went on in this way. We tortured ourselves, practised resignation,
but were drawn together again, and then D&ouml;derlein suddenly
began to be suspicious. Whether his suspicion was due to whisperings
or to what he himself had at some time seen his wife do&mdash;it
was impossible for her to play the hypocrite&mdash;I really do not know.
At any rate he began to abuse her in the most perfidious manner.
He tried to disturb her conscience. One night he went to her bed
with a crucifix in his hand, and made her swear, swear on the life
of her child, that she would never deceive him. He used all
manner of threats and unctuous fustian. She took the oath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my friend, she took the oath. And this oath seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>her much more solemn and serious than the oath she had taken at
the altar the day they were married. I knew nothing about it;
she kept out of my sight. I could not endure it. One day she
came to me again to say good-bye. There followed a moment
when human strength was no longer of avail, and human deliberation
the emptiest of words. The fatal situation developed. The
delicately moulded woman succumbed to a sense of guilt; her
heart grew irresponsive to feelings, her mind dark. She was
stricken with the delusion that her child was slowly dying in her
arms, and one day she collapsed completely. The rest is known.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benda got up, went over to the window, and looked out into
the darkness.</p>

<p>Daniel felt as if a rope were being tightened about his neck.
He too got up, murmured a farewell, and left.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>He had reached the Behaim monument when he began to walk
more slowly. A short distance before him he saw a man and a
woman. He recognized Dorothea.</p>

<p>They were speaking very rapidly and in subdued tones. Daniel
followed them; and when they reached the door of his house and
turned to go in, he stopped in the shadow of the church.</p>

<p>The man seemed to be angry and excited: Dorothea was trying
to quiet him. She was standing close by him; she held his hand
in hers until she unlocked the door. First she whispered, looked
up at the house anxiously, and then said out loud: &#8220;Good night,
Edmund. Sweet dreams!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man went on his way without lifting his hat. Dorothea
hastened in.</p>

<p>Daniel was trembling in his whole body. There was something
in his eyes that seemed to be beseeching; and there was something
mystic about them. He watched until the light had been
lighted upstairs and the window shade drawn. He was tortured
by the stillness of the Square; when the clock in the tower struck
eleven he thought he could hear the blood roaring in his ears.</p>

<p>It was only with difficulty that he dragged himself into the house.
Dorothea, already in her night-gown, was sitting at the table in the
living room, sewing a ribbon on the dress she had just been wearing:
it had somehow got loose.</p>

<p>They spoke to each other. Daniel stood behind her, near the
stove, and looked over at the back of her bared neck as if held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>by a spell. One cold shiver after another was running through
his body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who gave you those ostrich feathers?&#8221; he asked, suddenly and
rather brusquely. The question slipped from his lips before he
himself was aware of it. He would have liked to say something
else.</p>

<p>Dorothea raised her head with a jerk. &#8220;I thought I told you,&#8221;
she replied, and he noticed that she coloured up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot believe that a perfect stranger, and a woman at that,
is making you such costly presents,&#8221; said Daniel slowly.</p>

<p>Dorothea got up, and looked at him rather undecidedly. &#8220;Very
well, if you simply must know, I bought them myself,&#8221; she said
with unusual defiance. &#8220;But you don&#8217;t need to try to browbeat
me like that; I&#8217;ll get the money that I paid for them. And you
needn&#8217;t think for a minute that I am going to let you draw up a
family budget, and expect to make me live by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t buy those feathers,&#8221; said Daniel, cutting her off in
the middle of her harangue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t buy them, and they were not given to me! How
did I get them then? Stole them perhaps?&#8221; Dorothea was scornful;
but cowardice made it impossible for her to look Daniel in
the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never in my life talked to any one in this way, nor has
any one ever spoken to me like that,&#8221; thought Daniel to himself.
He turned deathly pale, went up to her, and placed his hand like
an iron vise about her arm. &#8220;I shall permit you to waste my money;
I shall not object if you fritter your time away in the company
of good-for-nothing people; if you regard my health and peace
of mind as of no consequence whatever, I shall say nothing; if you
let your poor little child suffer and pine away, I shall keep quiet.
I shall submit to all of this. And why shouldn&#8217;t I? Why should
I want to have my meals served at regular hours? Why should
I insist that my morning coffee be warm and my rolls fresh from
the baker? Why should I be so exacting as to ask that my clothes
be mended, my windows washed, my room swept, and my table in
order? I was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth; I have
never known what it was to be comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, listen, Daniel, it&#8217;s too bad about you,&#8221; said Dorothea in
an anxious tone, &#8220;but let go of my arm.&#8221;</p>

<p>He loosened his grip on her arm, but did not let it go. &#8220;You
may associate with whomsoever you please. Let those people
treasure you to whom you are a treasure. So far as money is concerned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>you can have all that I have. Here it is, take it.&#8221; He
drew from his pocket an embroidered purse filled with coins, and
hurled them on the table. &#8220;So that you can wear fine dresses, I
will play the organ on Sundays. So that you can go to masquerade
balls and parties of all kinds, I will try to beat a little music into
some twenty-odd unmusical idiots. I will do more than that: I
will promise never to bother myself about your behaviour: I will
never ask you where you have been or where you are going. But
listen, Dorothea,&#8221; he said, as his face flushed with anger and
anxiety, his voice rising as if by unconscious pressure, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
ever dare dishonour my name! It is the only thing I have. I owe
humanity an irreparable debt for it. It invests me not simply with
what is known as civic honour, it gives me also the honour I feel
and enjoy when I stand in the presence of what I have created.
Lie, and you besmirch my name! Lie, and you sully and debase
it! I am probably not as much afraid as you think I am of being
regarded as a cuckold, though I admit that the thought of it makes
my blood boil. But I want to say to you here and now, that
when I think of you in the arms of another man I feel within me
a deep desire, a real lust for murder. But you would throw me
into the last pit of hell and damnation, if you were to repay the
truths I have told you and given you with lies, lies, lies. You
must not, you dare not, imagine for a minute that I am so selfish
and vulgar as not to be able to understand that a change might
come over your heart. But that is one thing; telling a lie and
living a lie is quite another. It is impossible for me to live side
by side with another human being except in absolute truth. A
lie, the lie, crushes what there is in me of the divine. A lie to
me is carrion and corruption. Tell me, then, whether you have
been and are true to me! Don&#8217;t be afraid, Dorothea, and don&#8217;t
be ashamed. Everything may be right yet and work out as it
should. But tell me: Have you been deceiving me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;deceiving you?&#8221; breathed Dorothea, and looked into his face
as if hypnotised, never so much as moving an eyelash. &#8220;What
do you mean? Deceiving you? Do you really think that I would
be capable of such baseness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no lover? No other man has touched you since you
have been my wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A lover? Some other man has touched me?&#8221; she repeated
with that same hypnotic look. In her child-like face there was
the glow of unadulterated honour and undiluted innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been having no secret <i>rendezvous</i>, you have not been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>receiving treacherous letters, nor writing them, you have promised
no man anything, not even in jest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well now, Daniel, listen! In jest. That&#8217;s another matter.
Who knows? You know me, and you know how one talks and
laughs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you assure me that all this mysterious abuse that is being
whispered into my ears and to which your conduct has given a
certain amount of plausibility is nothing in the world but wickedness
on the part of people who know us, nothing but calumny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Daniel: it is merely wickedness, meanness, and calumny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are willing that God above should never grant you another
minute of peace, if you have been lying to me? Do you wish
that, Dorothea?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea balked; she blinked a little. Then she said quite
softly: &#8220;Those are terrible words, Daniel. But if you insist upon
it, I am willing to abide by the curse you have made a possibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel breathed a breath of relief. He felt that a mighty
load had been taken from his heart. And in grateful emotion he
went up to his wife, and pressed her to his bosom.</p>

<p>But at the same time he was repelled by something. He felt
that the creature he was pressing to his heart was without rhythm,
or vibration, or law, or order. He began again to be gnawed at
by torture, this time of a new species and coming from another
direction.</p>

<p>As he opened the door to the hall, he heard a rustle; and he
saw a dark figure hastening over to the room that opened on the
court.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Left alone, Dorothea stared for a while into space, as motionless
as a statue. Then she took her violin and bow from the case&mdash;she
had bought a new bow to take the place of the one that had
been broken&mdash;and began to play: a cadence, a trill, a waltz. Her
face took on a hardened, resolute expression.</p>

<p>She soon let the instrument fall from her hands, and began to
think. She laid the violin to one side, took off her slippers,
sneaked out of the room in her stocking feet and across the hall,
and listened at the door to Philippina&#8217;s room. She opened it cautiously
and heard a sound snoring from Philippina&#8217;s bed, which
stood next to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p><p>The lamp had almost burned down; it gave so little light that
the bed clothes could hardly be seen.</p>

<p>She stole up to Philippina&#8217;s couch of repose, step by step, without
making the slightest noise, bent down, stretched out her arm,
groped around over the body of the inexplicable creature who was
sleeping there, and was on the point of raising the covers and
reaching for Philippina&#8217;s breast. Philippina ceased snoring, woke
up as if she had been struck in the face by the rays of a magic
lantern, opened her eyes, and looked at Dorothea with a speechless
threat. Not a muscle of her face moved.</p>

<p>Dorothea collected her thoughts instantly. With the expression
on her face of one who has just succeeded in carrying out some
good joke, she threw her whole body on Philippina and pressed
her face to her cheek, nauseated though she was by the stench of
her breath and the bed clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Philippina, the American wants to give you something,&#8221;
she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus, you&#8217;re punching my belly in,&#8221; replied Philippina, and
gasped for breath. When Dorothea had straightened up, she said:
&#8220;Well, has he already given you something? That&#8217;s the main
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He gave me the feathers. Isn&#8217;t that something?&#8221; replied
Dorothea, &#8220;and he is going to give me a set of rubies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you already had &#8217;em. It seems to me that your American
don&#8217;t exactly hail from Givetown. I&#8217;ve been told that he
ain&#8217;t so damn rich after all. When are you goin&#8217; to meet him
again, your lover?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow evening, between six and seven. Oh, I am so glad,
so glad, Philippina. He is so young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, young! That&#8217;s a lot, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; murmured Philippina
contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has such a pretty mole on his neck, way down on his neck,
down there,&#8221; she said, pointing to the same spot on Philippina&#8217;s
neck. &#8220;Right there! Does it tickle you? Does it make you
feel good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t laugh so loud, you&#8217;ll waken little Gottfried,&#8221; said
Philippina in a testy, morose tone. &#8220;And get out of here! I&#8217;m
sleepy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, then, you pesky old dormouse,&#8221; said Dorothea,
in seemingly good-natured banter, and left the room.</p>

<p>Hardly had she closed the door behind her when Philippina
sprang like an enraged demon from her bed, clenched her fist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>and hissed: &#8220;Damned thief and whore! She wanted to rob me,
that&#8217;s what she did, the dirty wench! You wait! Your days in
this place are numbered. Somebody&#8217;s going to squeal, believe me,
and when they do, they&#8217;ll get you right.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew her red petticoat over her legs, tied it tightly, and
went to the door to lock it. The lock had been out of order for
some time; she could not budge it. She carried a chair over to
the door, placed it directly underneath the lock, folded her arms,
sat down on it, and remained sitting there for an hour or so blinking
her evil eyes.</p>

<p>When no longer able to keep from going to sleep, she got up,
placed the folding table against the door, and got back into bed,
murmuring imprecations such as were second nature to her.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The following day began with a heavy rain storm. Daniel had
had a restless night; he went to his work quite early. But his
head was so heavy that he had to stop every now and then, and rest
it on his hand. There was no blood, no swing to his ideas.</p>

<p>Toward eight o&#8217;clock the postman came, and asked for Inspector
Jordan. The old man had to sign a receipt in acknowledgment
of a solemnly sealed money order.</p>

<p>In the letter the postman gave him were two hundred dollars
in bills and a note from Benno. The letter had been mailed in
Galveston. Benno wrote that he had made inquiries and found
that his father was still living. He said he had been quite successful
in the New World, and as a proof of his prosperity he was
sending him the enclosed sum, with the best of greetings, in payment
for the trouble he had cost his father.</p>

<p>It was a cold epistle. But the old man was beside himself with
joy. He ran to Daniel and then to Philippina, held the crisp
notes in the air, and stammered: &#8220;Look, people! He is rich. He
has sent me two hundred dollars! He has become an honest man,
he has. He remembers his old father, he does! Really this is a
great day! A great day, Daniel, because of something else that
has just been finished.&#8221; He added with a mysterious smile: &#8220;A
blessed day in the history of a great cause!&#8221;</p>

<p>He dressed and went down town; he wanted to tell his friends
the news.</p>

<p>Daniel called down to know if his breakfast was ready; nobody
answered. Thereupon he went to the kitchen, and got himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>a bottle of milk and a loaf of bread. Philippina came in a little
later. Her hair looked as though a hurricane had struck it; she
was in her worst humour. She snarled at Daniel, asking him why
in the name of God he couldn&#8217;t wait till the coffee had been
boiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me in peace, Philippina,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I need peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace!&#8221; she roared, &#8220;peace, the same old story: you want peace!&#8221;
She threw a wild, contemptuous glance at the open chest containing
Daniel&#8217;s scores, leaned against the table, put the tips of her dirty
fingers on the score he was then studying, and shrieked: &#8220;There is
the cause of the whole <i>malheur</i>! The whole <i>malheur</i>, I say,
comes from this damned note-smearing of yours! The idea of a
man settin&#8217; down and dabbing them pot-hooks on good white paper,
day after day, year in and year out! What does it all mean? Tell
me! While you&#8217;re doin&#8217; it, everything else is moving&mdash;like a
crab, backwards. Jesus, you&#8217;re a man, and yet you spend your time
at that kind of stuff! I&#8217;d be ashamed to admit it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not prepared for this enigmatic outburst of anger and hate,
Daniel looked at Philippina utterly dazed. &#8220;Get out of here,&#8221; he
cried indignantly. &#8220;Get out of here, I say,&#8221; and pointed to the
door.</p>

<p>She got out. &#8220;The damned dabbery!&#8221; she bellowed with reinforced
maliciousness.</p>

<p>From ten to twelve, Daniel had to lecture at the conservatory.
His heart beat violently, though he was unable to explain his excitement.
It was more than a foreboding: he felt as if he had heard
a piece of terribly bad news and the real nature of it had slipped
his memory.</p>

<p>He did not go home for luncheon; he ate in the caf&eacute; at the
Carthusian Gate. Then he took a long walk out over the fields
and meadows. It had stopped raining, and the brisk wind refreshed
him. He stood for a long while on the banks of the canal, and
watched some men piling bricks at a brick-kiln. From time to
time he took a piece of paper from his pocket, and wrote something
on it with his pencil: it was notes.</p>

<p>Once he wrote alongside of a motif: &#8220;Farewell, my music!&#8221;
His eyes were filled with dreadful tears.</p>

<p>He returned to the city just as the sun was setting; it looked
like a huge ball of fire in the west. The sky shone out between
two great black clouds like the forge of a smithy. He could not
help but think of Eleanore.</p>

<p>He entered his living room, and paced back and forth. Philippina
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>came in, and asked him whether she should warm up his soup
for him. Her unnatural, singing tone attracted his attention; he
looked at her very closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my wife?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Philippina&#8217;s face betrayed an abysmally mean smile, but she
never said a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my wife?&#8221; he asked a second time, after a pause.</p>

<p>Philippina&#8217;s smile became brighter. &#8220;Is it cold out?&#8221; she asked,
and in a moment she had left the room. Daniel stared at her as if
he feared she had lost her mind. In a few minutes she came
back. In the meantime she had put on a cloak that was much
too short for her, and beneath which the loud, freakish skirt of
her checkered dress could be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel, come along with me,&#8221; she said in an anxious voice.
To Daniel her voice sounded mysterious and fearful. &#8220;Come along
with me, Daniel! I want to show you something.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned pale, put on his hat, and followed her. They
crossed the square in silence, went through Binder Street, Town
Hall Street, and across the Market. Daniel stopped. &#8220;What are
you up to?&#8221; he asked with a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along! You&#8217;ll see,&#8221; whispered Philippina.</p>

<p>They walked on, crossed the Meat Bridge, went through Kaiser
Street and the White Tower to St. James&#8217;s Place. Some people
looked at the odd couple in amazement. When they reached Frau
Hadebusch&#8217;s little house, it was dark. &#8220;Listen, Philippina, are you
ever going to talk?&#8221; said Daniel, gritting his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Psh!&#8221; Philippina knew what she was doing. She put her
mouth to Daniel&#8217;s ear, and whispered: &#8220;Go up two flights, quick,
you know the house, bang on the door, and if it&#8217;s locked, bust it in.
In the meantime I&#8217;ll go to Frau Hadebusch so that she can&#8217;t interfere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Daniel understood.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Everything became blood-red before his eyes; he was seized
with a feverish chill.</p>

<p>He had followed Philippina with a dejected, limp feeling of
disgust, fear and coercion. Now he knew what it was all about.
At the very beginning of the events he saw the middle and the
end. He saw before the bolted door what was going on behind
it. His soul was seized with horror, rage, woe, contempt, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>terror. He felt dizzy; he feared lie might lose consciousness.</p>

<p>He sprang up the creaking stairs by leaps and bounds. He stood
before the door behind which he had gone hungry, been cold, and
glowed with enthusiasm as a young man. Silence should have
reigned there now, so that the devotion of retrospective spirits
might not be molested on the grave of so many, many hopes.</p>

<p>He jerked at the latch; a scream was heard from within. The
door was bolted. He pressed his body against the fragile wood so
violently that both hinges, and the latch, gave way, and the door
fell on to the middle of the floor with a mighty crash.</p>

<p>The scream was repeated, this time in a more piercing tone.
Dorothea was lying on a big bed with nothing on but a flimsy
chemise. Frau Hadebusch, pimp always, had rented the bed from
a second-hand dealer; it covered a half of the room. Before
Dorothea was a plate of cherries; she had been amusing herself by
shooting the pits at her lover. He likewise was lacking nearly all
the garments ordinarily worn by men when in the presence of
women. He was sitting astride on a chair, smoking a short-stemmed
pipe.</p>

<p>When Daniel, with bloody hands&mdash;he had scratched himself
while breaking in the door&mdash;with his hair flying wild about his
face, panting, and pale as death, stepped over the door, Dorothea
again began to scream; she screamed seven or eight times. She
was filled with despair and terrible anxiety.</p>

<p>Daniel rushed at the young man, and seized him by the throat.
While he held the American in a death-like grip, while he saw
Dorothea, as if in a roseate haze, with uplifted arms, leave the
bed screaming at the top of her voice, while an extraordinary
power of observation, despite his insane rage, came over him, while
he watched the cherries as they rolled across the bed and saw
the green stems, some of which were withered, showing that the
cherries were half rotten, while he felt a taste on his tongue as if
he too had eaten cherries&mdash;while he saw all these things and had
this sensation, he thought to himself without either doubt or relief:
&#8220;This is the downfall; this is chaos.&#8221;</p>

<p>The American&mdash;it later became known that he was a wandering
artist who had, with an equal amount of nerve and adroitness,
worked his way into the private social life of the city&mdash;thrust his
antagonist back with all his might, and struck up the position of a
professional boxer. Daniel, however, gave him no time to strike;
he fell on him, wrapped his arms tight about him, threw him to
the floor, and was trying to choke him. He groaned, struggled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>got his fist loose, struck Daniel in the face, and cried, &#8220;You damned
fool!&#8221; But it was the cry of a whipped man.</p>

<p>Loud noise broke out downstairs. A crowd of people collected
on the sidewalk. &#8220;Police, police!&#8221; shrieked the shrill voice of a
woman. The people began to make their way up the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, oh!&#8221; moaned Dorothea. In half a minute she had
her dress on. &#8220;Out of this place and away,&#8221; she said, as she
looked for her gloves and umbrella.</p>

<p>Frau Hadebusch appeared in the hall, wringing her hands. Behind
her stood Philippina. Two men forced their way in, ran
up to Daniel and the American, and tried to separate them. But
they had bitten into each other like two mad dogs; and it was
necessary to call for help. A soldier and the milkman gave a
hand; and finally two policemen appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go home,&#8221; cried Dorothea, while the other women
shrieked and carried on. &#8220;I must go home, and get my things
and leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the face of one possessed and at the same time dumb,
Philippina stole out from among the excited crowd and followed
Dorothea. She did not feel that she was walking; she could not
feel the pavement under her feet; she was unconscious of the air.
That wild inspiration returned to her which she had experienced
once before in her life&mdash;the time she went up in the attic and
saw Gertrude&#8217;s lifeless body hanging from a rafter.</p>

<p>Her veins pulsed with a hot lust for destruction. &#8220;Swing the
torch!&#8221; That was the cry she heard running through her brain.
&#8220;Swing the torch!&#8221; But she wanted to do something much more
pretentious this time than merely start a fire in some rubbish.
The farther she went the more rapidly she walked. Finally she
began to run and sing with a loud, coarse voice. Her cloak was
not buttoned; it flew in the air. The people who saw her stopped
and looked at her, amazed.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Herr Carovius and Jordan were sitting in the Paradise Caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>&#8220;How things change, and how everything clears up and
straightens out!&#8221; remarked Jordan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the open graves are gaping again,&#8221; said Herr Carovius
cynically.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as I am concerned,&#8221; continued Jordan, without noticing
the aversion his affability had aroused in Herr Carovius, &#8220;I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>now face death with perfect peace of mind. My mission is ended;
my work is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds as if you had discovered the philosopher&#8217;s stone,&#8221;
remarked Herr Carovius sarcastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; replied Jordan gently and bent over the table. &#8220;You
are after all not entirely wrong, my honoured friend. Do you
wish to be convinced? Will you honour me with a visit?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herr Carovius had become curious. They paid their bills and
left for &AElig;gydius Place.</p>

<p>Having entered Jordan&#8217;s room, the old man lighted a lamp and
bolted the door. He then opened the door of the great cabinet
by the wall, and took out a big doll. It was dressed like a Swiss
maid, had on a flowered skirt, a linen waist, and a little pink apron.
Its yellow hair was done up in braids, and on its head was a little
felt hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;All that is my handiwork,&#8221; said Jordan, with much show of
pride. &#8220;I myself took all the measurements and made the clothes,
including even the shoes. And now watch, my dear friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>He placed the doll in the middle of the room. &#8220;She will
speak,&#8221; he continued, his face radiant with joy, &#8220;she will sing.
She will sing a song native to her beloved Tyrol. Will you be
so good as to take this chair? I would rather not have you so
close to it, if I may, for there are certain noises which I still have
to correct. The illusion is stronger when you are some distance
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crouched down behind the doll, did something at its back,
and the buzzing of wheels became audible. The old man then
stepped out to the front of the doll, and said: &#8220;Now, my little girl,
let&#8217;s hear what you can do!&#8221;</p>

<p>An uncanny, hoarse, somewhat cooing voice rang out from the
body of the doll. It sounded like the vibrations of metallic strings
accompanied by the low tones of a water whistle. If you closed
your eyes, you could at least imagine you were hearing a song sung
by some one in the distance. But if you looked at the thing closely
with its lifeless, mask-like kindly, waxen face, and heard the shrill,
muffled sounds, without either articulation or rhythm, coming from
within, it took on a ghostly aspect. Herr Carovius in fact felt a
cold chill creep down his back.</p>

<p>When the machine ran down, the doll&#8217;s eyelids and lips closed.
Jordan was looking at Herr Carovius in great suspense. &#8220;Well,
what do you think of it?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Be quite frank; I can stand
any amount of criticism.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p><p>Herr Carovius had great difficulty to keep from bursting out
laughing. His mouth and chin itched. Suddenly, however, scorn
and contempt left him; he fell into a disagreeably serious frame
of mind, and a softness, a mildness such as he had not felt since
time immemorial stole over his heart. He said: &#8220;That is a perfectly
splendid invention! Perfectly splendid! Though it does
need some improvement.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jordan nodded zealously and with joyous approval. He was
on the point of going into a detailed description of the mechanism
and its artistic construction, when the two men heard a strange
noise in the adjoining room. They stopped and listened. They
could hear some one moving the furniture; there were steps
back and forth; they heard a hammering and pounding as if
some one were trying to open a box. This was followed by a
sound that resembled the falling of paper on the floor; it lasted for
some time, bunch apparently following bunch. Listen! Some one
is talking in an abusive voice! What&#8217;s that? A gruesome, sing-song
voice repeating unintelligible words: &#8220;I-oi! huh, huh! I-oi,
huh-huh!&#8221; There is a sound as if of crackling fire. The flames
cannot be seen; but they can be heard!</p>

<p>Old Jordan jerked the door open, and cried like a child.</p>

<p>Philippina was standing in the midst of a pile of burning papers.
She had forced Daniel&#8217;s trunk open, thrown every one of his scores
on the floor, and set them on fire. She was a fearful object to
behold. Her hair hung down loose and straggly over her shoulders,
she was swinging her arms as if she were working a pump-handle,
and from her mouth poured forth a volley of loud, babbling,
gurgling tones that bore not the faintest resemblance to anything
human. Her face, lightened by the flames, was coloured with the
trace of fearful voluptuousness. Herr Carovius and old Jordan
stood in the doorway as if paralysed. Seeing them, she began to
hop about, and stretched out her upraised arms to the flames, which
were leaping higher and higher.</p>

<p>Herr Carovius, awakening from his torpidity, saw that it was
high time to make some effort to escape. Shielding his face with
his hands, he fled as fast as his feet could carry him to the hall
door and down the steps. Tears were gushing down Jordan&#8217;s
cheeks; fear had made it impossible for him to reflect. He ran back
into his room, opened the window, and called out to the people
on the square. Then he chanced to think of his beloved doll.
He rushed up to it and took it under his arm. But when he tried
to leave the room, the smoke blew into his face, benumbing and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>burning him. He staggered, reached the top of the stairs, made
a misstep, fell headlong down the steps, still holding the doll in
convulsive embrace, twitched a few times, and then lay lifeless
on the hall floor.</p>

<p>Heart failure had put an end to his life.</p>

<p>Dorothea, who had been in the house packing her things,
hastened, luggage in hand, past the corpse. Her face was ashen;
she never looked at the dead body of Inspector Jordan. She was
soon lost in the crowd of excited people. She had vanished.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>The police had at last separated Daniel and the American in
Frau Hadebusch&#8217;s house. Daniel fell on a chair, and gazed
stupidly into space. Frau Hadebusch brought him some water.
The American put on his clothes, while the spectators looked on
and laughed.</p>

<p>The two men were then taken to the police station, where the
lieutenant in charge took such depositions as were necessary for
court action. Daniel saw a gas lamp, a quill pen, several grinning
faces, his own bloody hand, and nothing more. The American
was held in order to protect him from further attacks; Daniel
was released. He heard the young man tell his story in a mangled
German and with a voice that was nearly choked with rage, but
did not absorb anything he said.</p>

<p>He heard a dog bark, a wagon rattle, a bell strike; he heard
people talking, murmuring, crying; he heard the scraping of feet.
But it all sounded to him like noises that were reaching his ears
through the walls of a prison. He went on his way; his gait
was unsteady.</p>

<p>As he reached the Church of Our Lady, Daniel turned to the
right toward the Market Place, and saw the Goose Man standing
before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go home,&#8221; the Goose Man seemed to say with a sad voice.
&#8220;Go home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you? what do you wish of me?&#8221; A voice within
him asked. But then it seemed that the figure had become invisible,
and that it could not be seen again until it was far off in
the distance, where it was being shone upon by a bright light.</p>

<p>People were running across &AElig;gydius Place; some of them were
crying &#8220;Fire!&#8221; Daniel turned the corner; he could see his house.
Flames were leaping up behind his window. He pressed his hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>to his temples, and, with eyes wide open and filled with terror, he
forced his way through the crowd up to his house. &#8220;For God&#8217;s
sake, for Heaven&#8217;s sake!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;save my trunk!&#8221;</p>

<p>Many looked at him. A figure appeared at the window; many
arms were pointed at it. &#8220;The woman! Look, look, the woman!&#8221;
came a cry from the crowd. And then again: &#8220;She has set the
house on fire! She has swung the torch and started the fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel rushed into his house. Firemen overtook him. There
he saw in the hall, lighted by the lanterns being carried back and
forth so swiftly, and placed in the corner with no more care or
consideration than was possible under such circumstances, the dead
body of old Jordan. His body, and close beside it, as if in supernatural
mockery of all things human, the doll, the Swiss maid
with the machine in her stomach. Sighing and sobbing, he fell
down; his forehead touched the dead hand of the old man.</p>

<p>As if in a dream he heard the hissing of the hoses, the commands,
the hurried running back and forth of the firemen. Then
he felt as if a shadow, a figure from the lower world, suddenly
rose before him. A clenched fist, he thought, opened and hurled
shreds of paper into his face. When he looked up he could see
nothing but the firemen rushing around him. The shadow, the
figure, had pushed its way in among them, and in the confusion
no one had paid any attention to it.</p>

<p>With an absent-minded gesture, Daniel reached out and picked
up the paper that was lying nearest him. It had fallen on the
face of the doll. He unfolded it and saw, written in his own
hand, the music to the &#8220;Harzreise im Winter.&#8221; Under the notes
were the words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But aside, who is it?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His path in the bushes is lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind him rustle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thickets together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grass rises again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The desert conceals him.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The melody and rhythm that interpreted the words were of a
grandiose gloominess, like a song of shades pursued in the night,
across the sea. Daniel recalled the hour he had written this music;
he recalled the expression on Gertrude&#8217;s face the time he played
it for her. Eleanore was there, too, wearing a white dress, with
a myrtle wreath in her hair. The tones dissolved the web of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>infinite time. &#8220;But aside, who is it?&#8221; came forth like a great,
deep dirge. In the question there was something prophetically
great. He covered his face and wept; he felt as if his heart
would break.</p>

<p>The dead man and the doll were lying there, motionless, lifeless.</p>

<p>In half an hour the fire was under control. The two attic
rooms had been burned out completely. Further than this no
damage had been done.</p>

<p>Philippina had vanished without a trace. Since no one had
seen her leave the house, the first theory was that she had been
burned to death. But investigation proved this assumption to be
incorrect. The police looked for her everywhere, but in vain;
she was not to be found. A few people who had known her
rather intimately insisted that she had been burned up so completely
that there was nothing left of her but a little pile of black ashes.</p>

<p>However this may be, and whatever the truth may be, Philippina
never again entered the house. No one ever again saw or heard a
thing of her.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span><a name="BUT_ASIDE_WHO_IS_IT" id="BUT_ASIDE_WHO_IS_IT"></a>BUT ASIDE, WHO IS IT?</h2>

<h3>I</h3>


<p><span class="firstword">Late</span> in the evening Benda came. He had been tolerably well
informed of everything that had taken place. In the hall he met
Agnes. Though generally quite monosyllabic, Agnes was now
inclined to be extremely communicative, but she could merely confirm
what he had already heard.</p>

<p>She went up to the top floor with him, and he stood there for a
long while looking at the burnt rooms. There were two firemen
on guard duty. &#8220;All of his music has been burnt up,&#8221; said Agnes.
Benda thought he would hardly be able to talk with his old friend
again after this tragedy. But he at once felt ashamed of his
timidity, and went down to see him.</p>

<p>It was again quiet throughout the entire house.</p>

<p>Daniel had lighted a candle in the living room. Finding it too
dark with only one candle, he lighted another.</p>

<p>He paced back and forth. The room seemed too small for him:
he opened the door leading into Dorothea&#8217;s room, and walked
back and forth through it too. On entering the dark room, his
lips would move; he would murmur something. When he returned
to the lighted room, he would stand for a second or two and stare
at the candles.</p>

<p>His features seemed to show traces of human suffering such as
no man had borne before; it could hardly have been greater. He
did not seem to notice Benda when he came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything gone? Everything destroyed?&#8221; asked Benda, after
he had watched Daniel walk back and forth for nearly a quarter
of an hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;One grave after the other,&#8221; murmured Daniel, in a voice that
no longer seemed to be his own. He raised his head as if surprised
at the sound of what he himself had said. He felt that
a stranger had come into the room without letting himself be heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the last work, the great work of which you told me,
the fruit of so many years, has it also been destroyed?&#8221; asked
Benda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;Everything,&#8221; replied Daniel distractedly, &#8220;everything I have
created in the way of music from the time I first had reason to
believe in myself. The sonatas, the songs, the quartette, the psalm,
the &#8216;Harzreise,&#8217; &#8216;Wanderers Sturmlied,&#8217; and the symphony, everything
down to the last page and the last note.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, there was a stranger there; you could hear him laughing
quietly to himself. &#8220;Why do you laugh?&#8221; asked Daniel sternly,
and adjusted his glasses.</p>

<p>Benda, terrified, said: &#8220;I did not laugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The grass rises again, the desert conceals him,&#8221; said the stranger.
He wore an old-fashioned suit, a droll sort of cap, and Hessian
boots. &#8220;I ought to know him,&#8221; thought Daniel to himself, and
began to meditate with cloudy mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is like murder, unheard-of murder,&#8221; cried Benda&#8217;s soul;
&#8220;how can he bear it? What will he do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there to do?&#8221; asked Daniel, expressing Benda&#8217;s silent
thought in audible words, and looking askew, as he walked back
and forth, at the stranger who went slowly through the room over
to the window in the corner. &#8220;What can human fancy find reasonable
or possible after all that has happened? Nothing! Merely
pine away; pine away in insanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho,&#8221; said the stranger, &#8220;that is a trifle strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he would only keep quiet,&#8221; thought Daniel, tortured. &#8220;I
presume you know what has happened with the woman whom I
called my wife,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;That I threw myself away on
this vain, soulless spirit of a mirror is irrelevant. Greater men
than I have walked into such nets and become entangled, ensnared.
I have never cherished the delusion that I was immune to all the
mockery of this earth. I believed, however, that I could scent out
truth and falsehood, and differentiate the one from the other, just
as the hand can tell by the feel the wet from the dry. But the
connection of the one with the other, and the horrible necessity
of this connection, I do not understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been served just right,&#8221; remarked the intruder with
the Hessian boots. He had sat down on a chair in the corner, and
looked quite friendly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; roared Daniel, stopping.</p>

<p>Benda, astounded, rose to his feet. &#8220;Speak out, Daniel,&#8221; he said
affectionately, &#8220;unburden your soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I only could, Friedrich, if I only could! If my tongue
would only move! Or if there were some one who felt with me
and could speak for me!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;Try it; the first word is often like a spark and starts a flame.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel was silent. The intruder said deliberatively: &#8220;That goes
deep down to the recesses of the heart and up high to the things
that are immortal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel looked over at him sharply, and saw that it was the
Goose Man.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>All effort to get Daniel to talk was in vain. Along toward
midnight, Benda took leave of him. Agnes unlocked the door for
him; he said to her: &#8220;Look after him; he has no one else now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel lay on the sofa with his hands crossed behind his head,
and stared at the ceiling. His eyes were hot; at times he trembled
and shook.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t very sociable here,&#8221; said the Goose Man, &#8220;the air is
full of tobacco smoke, and there is a draft coming in from that
dark room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel got up, closed the door, and lay down again.</p>

<p>The metallic exterior of the Goose Man seemed to become
flexible, somewhat as when a frozen body thaws out. &#8220;You have
gone through a great deal,&#8221; he continued thoughtfully. &#8220;That
any one who wishes to create must also experience is clear. Experience
is his mother&#8217;s milk, his realm of roots; it is where the saps
flow together, from which his forms and figures are developed.
But there is experience and experience, and between the two there
is a world of difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Superfluous profundity,&#8221; murmured Daniel, plainly annoyed.
&#8220;To live is to have experience.&#8221; He took council with himself
in the attempt to devise a means by which he might get rid of the
importunate chatterer.</p>

<p>The Goose Man again struck up his gentle laugh. He replied:
&#8220;Many live, and yet do not live; suffer, and yet do not suffer.
In what does guilt lie? What does it consist of? In not feeling;
in not doing. The first thing for some men to do is to eradicate
completely the false notions they have of what constitutes greatness.
For what is greatness after all? It is nothing in the world but the
fulfilment of an unending circle of petty duties, small obligations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a fundamental difference between the creator and all
other men,&#8221; remarked Daniel, at once excited and troubled by the
conversation and the turn it was taking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you appeal to, depend on, refer to music in this present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>case?&#8221; asked the Goose Man, his good-natured look becoming more
or less disdainful.</p>

<p>&#8220;In music every creation is more closely related to an unconditional
exterior than is true of anything else that man gives to
man,&#8221; answered Daniel. &#8220;The musical genius stands nearer God
than any other genius.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Goose Man nodded. &#8220;But his fall begins one step from
God&#8217;s throne, and is a high and deep one. Do you know what
you are? And do you really know what you are not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel pressed his hand to his heart: &#8220;Have you ever known me
to fight for evanescent laurels? Have I ever tried to feed the
human race, which is a race of minors, on surrogates? Have I
ever imitated the flights of Heaven with St. Vitus dance, confusing
the one with the other? Have I not always acted in accord with
the best, the inmost knowledge I had, and in obedience to my conscience?
Was I ever a liar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no!&#8221; cried the Goose Man, by way of appeasing
Daniel&#8217;s unrest. He took off his cap, and laid it on his knee.
&#8220;You were always sincere. There can be no doubt about it, your
heart was always in your profession. All life has streamed into
your soul, and you have lived in the ivory tower. Your soul was
well protected, well protected from the very beginning. It was
in a position similar to that created by a swimmer who rubs his
body with grease before plunging into the water. You have suffered;
the poison of the Nessus shirt you have worn has burned
your skin, and the pain you have thereby suffered has been transformed
into sweet sounds. So they all are, the creators, invulnerable
and inaccessible. That is the way you picture them to
yourself. Is it not true? Monsters who take up the cross of the
world, and yet, grief-laden though they be, grow beyond their own
fate. Such is your lot; and so do you look to-day in your forty-second
year.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel was not prepared for this tone of bitterness; he turned
his face to the corner where the Goose Man was sitting. &#8220;I do
not understand you,&#8221; he said slowly. The pitiable crying of little
Gottfried could be heard from the room opening out on the court,
and then Agnes&#8217;s quieting lullaby.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you only had not lived in the ivory tower!&#8221; cried the Goose
Man. &#8220;If you only had been more sensitive and not so well protected!
If you had only lived, lived, lived, really and truly, and
near to life, like a naked man in a thicket of thorns! Life would
have got the best of you, but your love would have been real, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>hate you have experienced real, your misfortunes real, the lies,
ridicule, and betrayal all real, and the shadows of those who have
died from you would have taken on reality. And the poison of
the Nessus shirt would not merely have burned your skin; it would
have penetrated to your very blood, it would have found its way
to the deepest, most secret recesses of your heart. Your work
would have been carried on and out, not in a struggle against your
darkness and your limited torments of soul, a slave before men and
unblessed of God. Eliminate from your mind now, forever and
completely, the delusion that you have borne the sufferings of the
world! You have merely borne your own sufferings, loving-loveless,
altruistic-egoist, monster, man without a country that you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you? What are you trying to say?&#8221; asked Daniel,
automatically, falteringly, with pale lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t you see who I am? I am the Goose Man,&#8221; came
the reply, spoken with a loyal and devoted bow. &#8220;The Goose
Man, lonesome there behind the iron fence, lonesome there on the
water at the fountain, and yet situated in the middle of the
Market. An insignificant being, tangible and intelligible to every
one who passes by, though a certain degree of monumentality has
been ascribed to me in all these years. But I pay no attention to
this ascription of greatness; I laugh at it. I give the Market, where
the people come and haggle over the price of potatoes and apples,
a certain degree of dignity. That is all. They see me as I stand
there, always upright, under the open sky; and despite my distinguished
position, they have all come to look upon me as a cousin.
For a time they gave me a nickname: they called me by your name.
But they had no right to do this; none at all, it seems to me. I
have looked out for my geese; no one can say a thing against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Goose Man laughed a quiet, inoffensive laugh; and when
Daniel turned his face to the corner, the chair was empty, the
strange guest had vanished.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>But he came back. And when Daniel&#8217;s mind and body were
both completely broken down and he was obliged to remain in
bed, his visits became regular. He sat next to Benda, for Benda
had taken to calling on Daniel now every day and staying with him
until late at night. But Daniel grew quieter and quieter. Sometimes
he would make no reply at all to Benda&#8217;s remarks or questions.</p>

<p>The Goose Man came in behind Dr. Dingolfinger and stood on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>tiptoes, as curious as curious could be, and looked over his arm
when he wrote out his prescriptions. The Goose Man was a little
fellow: he hardly reached up to the doctor&#8217;s hips.</p>

<p>He hopped around Agnes when she cooked the soup and expressed
his sympathy for her; she looked so pale. Though only thirteen
years old, there was the worried look of a mature woman in her
face; she would cast her eyes around the room as if trying to
catch a glance of human love in the eyes of another person; her
looks were timid and stealthy. &#8220;Some one should be caring for her
too,&#8221; said the Goose Man, shaking his head, &#8220;some one should be
making a good, warm soup for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though it would be unfair to say that the Goose Man was
offensively concerned, he seemed to be interested in everything
that was going on in the house. When the officials of the fire
department came to cross-question Daniel about the fire, he became
angry and gruff, and did not wish to let them in. &#8220;Give the poor
man some rest, some peace, after all these years of suffering,&#8221; he
implored, &#8220;give him time to collect himself and to meditate on
what has taken place.&#8221; And in fact the members of the fire department
left as soon as possible; they did not stay long.</p>

<p>The Goose Man was always in a cheerful humour, always ready
for a good joke. At times he would whistle softly, and smooth
out the wrinkles in his doublet. There was a certain amount of
rustic shyness about him, but his affability, his good manners, and
his child-like cheerfulness removed any unpleasant impression this
rusticity might otherwise have made. He generally spoke the dialect
of Nuremberg, though when with Daniel he never spoke anything
but the most correct and chosen High German. His natural,
acquired culture and the wealth of his vocabulary were really
amazing.</p>

<p>Ten times a day at least he would scamper into the room where
little Gottfried was sleeping and express his admiration for the
pretty child. &#8220;How you are to be envied to have such a living
creature crawling and sprawling around in your home!&#8221; he said
to Daniel. And in course of time Daniel actually came to have
a new affection for the child.</p>

<p>As soon as the Goose Man felt perfectly at home in Daniel&#8217;s
house, he took to bringing his two geese along with him. He
would place them very circumspectly in a corner of the room.
One evening he was sitting playing with them, when the bell rang.
Andreas D&ouml;derlein stormed in, and demanded that some one tell
him where his daughter was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;Upon my word and honour! An old acquaintance of mine!&#8221;
said the Goose Man, laughing and blinking. &#8220;I see him nowadays
in the caf&eacute; much more frequently than is good for his health.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must urgently request you to control yourself,&#8221; said Benda,
turning to Andreas D&ouml;derlein, and pointed to the bed in which
Daniel was lying.</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter is not a bad woman. Let people overburdened
with credulity believe that she is bad,&#8221; cried D&ouml;derlein, with the
expression and in the tone and gesture of the royal Lear, and
shook his Olympian locks. &#8220;The fact is that violence has been
practised on her; she has been driven into ruin! Men have stolen
the sweet love of my dearly beloved daughter through the use of
vile tricks and artifices. Where is she, the unfortunate, betrayed
child? With what is she clothing her nakedness, and how is she
finding food and shelter&mdash;shelter in a world of wicked men?&#8221;</p>

<p>A strange thing happened: the Goose Man took the gigantic
arm of the Olympian, put his mouth to his beefy ear, and, with
a sad and reproachful look on his face, whispered something to
him. D&ouml;derlein turned red and then pale, looked down at the
floor, and went away with heavy, rumbling step but silent lips.
The Goose Man folded his arms across his breast, and looked at
D&ouml;derlein thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is said to have taken to drinking,&#8221; remarked Benda, &#8220;is
said to be living a wild, dissipated life. It seems incredible to
me. The D&ouml;derleins are generally content to stroll in lust along
the banks of the slimy sea of vice and let other people fall in.
The D&ouml;derleins are born in false ermine, and they die in false
ermine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet he is a human being,&#8221; said the Goose Man, so that
only Daniel could hear him.</p>

<p>Daniel sighed.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It was late at night. Daniel could not sleep. The Goose Man
crouched at his feet on the edge of the bed, and looked at him as
one looks at a dear brother who is suffering intense pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot deny that it is difficult for you to continue your life,&#8221;
said the Goose Man, trying to subdue his bright voice. &#8220;When
we sum up your situation, we see day following day, night following
night, and nothing happening that can be a cause for rejoicing.
Everything has been cut off; the threads have all been broken; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>foundation on which you built has been completely annihilated.
You are like the mother of many children who loses them all, all
of them, on a single day by one terrible stroke. The labour of
years remains unrewarded; your work has been in vain; in vain the
blood your heart has poured out, the deprivations you have submitted
to; your whole past is like a bad, disordered dream. Oh, I
understand full well; I appreciate your situation. It seems hard,
very hard, to go on and not to despair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel covered his face with his hands and moaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever asked yourself how the hand of murder came
to strike you? Ah, this Philippina! This daughter of Jason
Philip! I am almost four hundred years old, but such a person
I have never seen or known. But look back over your past! Do
it just once! Open your eyes; they are pure now and capable of
beholding. Have you not suffered the Devil to live by your side,
to take part in your life? And were you not at the same time
impatient with the angels who spread their wings about you as my
geese spread theirs about me? The Devil has grown fat from
you. The vampire has battened on you, has fed on your blood.
All this comes about when one is unwilling to give, when one
merely takes and takes and takes. That makes the Devil fat; the
vampire becomes greedier with each passing sun. Ah, so many good
genii have fled from you! Many you have frightened away, you,
bewitched, you, enchanted! Well, what now? What next? Hell
has claimed its full booty; Heaven can now open again to your
new-born heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no Heaven,&#8221; groaned Daniel, &#8220;there is nothing but
blackness and darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You still breathe, your heart is still beating, you still have
five fingers on each hand,&#8221; replied the Goose Man quietly. &#8220;He
who has paid his debts is a free man: you have paid yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am my own debt, my own guilt. If I continue to live, I
will sin again. Were I to live over the past, back into the past,
I would contract the same debts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is such a thing as a transformation, and through it
one receives absolution. Turn away from your phantom and become
a human being&mdash;and then you can become a creator. If you
once become human, really human, it may be that you will not
need the work, symphony or whatever else you choose to call it.
It may be that power and glory will radiate from you yourself.
For are not all works merely the round-about ways, the detours of
the man himself, merely man&#8217;s imperfect attempts to reveal himself?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>Did you not love a mask of plaster more than the countenances
that shone upon you, the faces that wept about you? Did you
not allow another mask, a thing of the mirror, to get control over
you, and so to besmirch your soul and strike your spirit with
paralysis? How can a man be a creator if he deceives, stunts, and
abbreviates the humanity that is in him? It is not a question of
ability, Daniel Nothafft, it is a question of being, living, being.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel tossed his head back and forth on his pillow, writhing
in agony. &#8220;Stop!&#8221; he gulped, &#8220;stop, stop!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Goose Man bent over him, and crouched up nearer to his
body like an animal trying to get warm. &#8220;Come out of the convulsion,&#8221;
something cried and exhorted within him, &#8220;break your
chains! Your music can give men nothing so long as you yourself
are held captive. Feel their distress! Have pity on their unplumbed
loneliness! Behold mankind! Behold it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is so much,&#8221; replied Daniel in extreme torture, &#8220;a
hundred thousand faces bewilder me, a hundred thousand pictures
hem me in. I cannot differentiate; I must flee, flee!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something inimitably tender, reassuring, and resigned
in what the Goose Man then said: &#8220;I speak to you as Christ:
Rise and walk! Rise and go in peace, Daniel! Go with me to
my place. Be <i>me</i> for just one day, from morning to evening,
and <i>I</i> will be <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel got up, and before he was conscious of what he was
doing, he had put on his clothes and was out on the street with
the Goose Man. They crossed the market place, and Daniel, in
a crepuscular state of mind, climbed up, with the help of the
Goose Man, and took his place on the base of the fountain behind
the iron railing. The two geese he took under his arms. He
stood perfectly still, rigid, just like the Goose Man, and waited
in anticipation of the things that were to come.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>But nothing extraordinary happened. Everything that took
place was quite prosaic and obviously a matter of custom.</p>

<p>The sun rose, and the market women took the cords and covers
from their baskets. Fresh cherries, young pears, and winter apples
shone in all their brilliancy of colour and lent variety to the drab
square. Sparrows picked in the straw that lay on the street. The
sun rose higher; its early red gave way to a midday blue. Clouds
drifted over the roof of the church. The women gossiped.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>Wagons rattled by, errand boys called to each other, curtains were
drawn from the windows, and men and women looked out to see
what the weather was going to be like. There were sleepy faces
and anxious faces, good faces and bad faces, young and old.</p>

<p>Maids and humbler housewives came to make their purchases.
They examined the fruit with seasoned care and experienced hand,
and bargained for lower prices. The peasant women praised what
they had, and if their praise was ineffectual, they became abusive.
Once a sale had been made, they would take their balances, put
the weights in one pan and the fruit in another, and never cease
praising what they were selling until they had the money safe in
their pockets. Then they would count over the coins they had
received, and looked at them as if to say: &#8220;It is fine to earn money!&#8221;</p>

<p>But those who paid out the money bore the mien of painful
care and solicitude. They seemed to be counting it all up in their
heads; to be taking lessons in mental arithmetic. They would
think over how much it were wise or permissible for them to spend.
The thing that impressed Daniel most of all, and the longer he
stood there the clearer it became to him, was this: Each purchaser
went right up to the very edge of the territory staked out for her,
so to speak, by some mysterious master. This they felt was correct,
certain though they were that to have gone beyond the allotted
limit would have brought swift and irremediable ruin. The money
was paid out with such studied caution, and taken in with such a
sense of victory! There was something touching about it all. This
daily life of these small people seemed so strange, so very strange,
and at the same time so in accord with established order: it seemed
indeed to be a practical visualisation of the sanctity of the law.</p>

<p>In all the transactions due respect was paid to the formalities of
life, and nothing was veiled. There was fulness, but no confusion;
many words, but no misunderstanding. There were the wares and
there were the coins. The scales showed how much was being
given and how much taken. The fruit wandered from basket to
basket, and human arms carried it home. Each bought as much as
could be paid for; there was no thought of going beyond one&#8217;s
means.</p>

<p>The clock in the tower struck on the hour, and the shadows
moved in a circle about the objects on the square. So it was to-day;
and so it had been four hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Four hundred years ago the houses stood there just as they stood
to-day, and people, men and women, looked out of the windows,
some with kindly, some with embittered faces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p><p>Is that not Theresa Schimmelweis creeping around the corner?
How old, decrepit, and bent with years! Her hair is stone grey,
her face is like lime. She is poorly dressed; she does not notice
the people she meets. She sees nothing but the full baskets of
fruit; for them she has a greedy eye. And she looks at Daniel
behind the iron fence with an expression of painful astonishment.</p>

<p>And is that not Frau Hadebusch hobbling along over there!
Though her face is that of a crafty criminal, in her eyes there is
a panicky, terrified look. She has no support other than the
ground beneath her feet; she is a poor, lost soul.</p>

<p>There comes Alfons Diruf, who retired years ago. He has become
stout and gloomy. He is out for his morning walk along the
city moat. There goes the actor, Edmund Hahn, seeking whom
he may devour. Disease and lust are writ large across his jaded
face. There is the sculptor, Schwalbe. He is secretly buying a
few apples to take home to roast, for otherwise he has nothing
warm to eat. And there is Herr Carovius, ambling along. He
looks like a wandering spirit, dejected and exhausted.</p>

<p>Beggars pass by, and so do the rich. There are respected people
who are greeted by those who see them; there are outcasts who are
shunned. There are those who are happy and those who are
weighed down with grief. Some hasten and some hesitate. Some
seem to hold fast to their lives as a lover might hold fast to his
fianc&eacute;e; others will die that same day. One has a child by the
hand, another a woman by the arm. Some drag crimes in their
hearts, others walk upright, free, happy to face the world. One is
being summoned to court as a witness, the other is on his way to
the doctor. One is fleeing from domestic discord, another is
rejoicing over some great good fortune. There is the man who has
lost his purse and the man who is reading a serious letter. One is
on his way to church to pray, another to the caf&eacute; to drown his
sorrows. One is radiant with joy over the business outlook, another
is crushed with poverty. A beautiful girl has on her best dress; a
cripple lies in the gateway. There is a boy who sings a song, and
a matron whose eyes are red with weeping. The baker carries his
bread by, the cobbler his boots. Soldiers are going to the barracks,
workmen are returning from the factory.</p>

<p>Daniel feels that none of them are strangers to him. He sees
himself in each of them. He is nearer to them while standing on
his elevated position behind the iron railing than he was when he
walked by them on the street. The jet of water that spurts from
him is like fate: it flows and collects in the basin. Eternal wisdom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>he feels, is streaming up to him from the fountain below; each hour
becomes a century. However men may be constituted, he is seized
with a supernatural feeling when he looks into their eyes. In all
of their eyes there is the same fire, the same anxiety and the same
prayer; the same loneliness, the same life, the same death. In all
of them he sees the soul of God.</p>

<p>He himself no longer feels his loneliness; he feels that he has
been distributed among men. His hate has gone, dispelled like so
much smoke. The tones he hears now come rushing up from the
great fountain; and this fountain is fed from the blood of all
those he sees on the market place. Water is something different
now: &#8220;It washes clean man&#8217;s very soul, and makes it like an angel,
whole.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noon came, and then evening: a day of creation. And when
evening came, a mist settled over the city, and Daniel came down
from his high place at the fountain, set the geese carefully to one
side, and went home. He arrived at the vestibule; he stood in the
door of the room looking out on the court. His eyes beheld a
wonderful sight.</p>

<p>The Goose Man was sitting playing with Agnes and little Gottfried.
He had cut silhouettes from bright coloured paper and
made them stand up on the table by bending back the edge of the
paper. There he sat, pushing these figures into each other, and
making such droll remarks that Agnes, who had never in her life
really laughed, laughed now with all her heart, and like the child
that she in truth still was.</p>

<p>Little Gottfried could only prattle and clap his hands. The
Goose Man had placed him on the table. Whenever he made a
false or awkward move, the Goose Man would set him right. He
seemed to be especially skilled at handling and amusing children.</p>

<p>When Daniel came in, the Goose Man got up and went over
to him, greeted him, and said in a kindly, confidential tone: &#8220;Are
you back so soon? We have had such a nice time!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the room, however, there was the same haze that had settled
down over the city when Daniel left the fountain. Agnes and
Gottfried were seized with a terrible fear. The boy began to cry;
Agnes threw her arms around him and cried too.</p>

<p>Daniel went up to them, and said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t cry! I&#8217;m with you.
You don&#8217;t need to cry any more!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down on the same seat on which the Goose Man had
been sitting, looked at the tiny paper figures, and, smiling, continued
the game the Goose Man had been playing with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p><p>Gottfried became quiet and Agnes happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night!&#8221; cried the Goose Man, &#8220;now I am again myself,
and you are you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded kindly and disappeared.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>That same evening six of Daniel&#8217;s pupils came in. They had
heard that he had been removed from his position at the conservatory.</p>

<p>It was not a mere rumour. Andreas D&ouml;derlein had had him
discharged. He was also relieved of his post as organist at St.
&AElig;gydius&#8217;s. The scandal with which he had been associated, and
which was by this time known to the entire city, had turned the
church authorities against him.</p>

<p>The six pupils came into his room where he was playing with his
children. One of them, who had been chosen as their spokesman,
told him that they had made up their minds not to leave him; they
were anxious to have him continue the instruction he had been
giving them.</p>

<p>They were clever, vivacious young chaps. In their eyes was an
enthusiasm that had not yet been dimmed either by cowardice or
conceit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to remain in the city,&#8221; said Daniel. &#8220;I am
planning to return to my native Eschenbach.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pupils looked at each other. Thereupon the speaker remarked:
&#8220;We want to go with you.&#8221; They all nodded.</p>

<p>Daniel got up and shook hands with each one of them.</p>

<p>Two days later, Daniel&#8217;s furniture and household belongings
had all been packed. Benda came to say good-bye: his work, his
great duty was calling him.</p>

<p>At first Benda could hardly realise that Daniel was yet to live
an active life; that there was still a whole life in him; that his
life was not merely the debris of human existence, the ruins of a
heart. But it was true.</p>

<p>There was about Daniel the expression, the bearing of a man
who had been liberated, unchained. No one could help but notice
it. Though more reticent and laconic than in former days, his
eyes had taken on a new splendour, a renewed brilliancy and
clarity; they were at once serious and cheerful. His mood had
become milder, his face more peaceful.</p>

<p>The friends shook hands. Benda then left the room slowly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>went down the steps slowly, and once out on the street he walked
along slowly: he felt so small, so strangely unimportant.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Daniel returned to Eschenbach, and moved into the house of
his parents. His pupils took rooms with the residents of the
village.</p>

<p>He was regarded by the natives as a peculiar individual. They
smiled when they spoke of him, or when they saw him passing
through the streets absorbed in his own thoughts. But it was not a
malicious smile. If there was the faintest tinge of ridicule in it at
first, it soon gave way to a vague feeling of pride.</p>

<p>He gained a mysterious influence over people with whom he came
in contact; many sought his advice when in trouble. His pupils
especially adored him. He had the gift of holding their attention,
of carrying them along. The means he employed were the very
simplest: his splendid, cheerful personality, the harmony between
what he said and what he did, his earnestness, his humanness, his
resignation to the cause that lay close to his heart, and his own belief
in this cause&mdash;those were the means through which and by which
he gained a mysterious influence over those with whom he came in
touch.</p>

<p>He became a famous teacher; the number of pupils who wished
to study under him increased from year to year. But he admitted
very few of them to his classes. He took only the best; and the
certainty with which he made his selections and differentiated was
wellnigh infallible.</p>

<p>No inducements of any kind could persuade him to leave the
isolated place where he had elected to live.</p>

<p>He was almost always in a good humour; he was never distracted;
and the preciseness and sharpness with which he observed
whatever took place was remarkable. The one thing that could
throw him into a rage was to see some one abuse a dumb beast.
Once he got into trouble with a teamster who was beating his skinny
old jade in order to make it pull a load that was far in excess of its
strength. The boys on the street made fun of him; the people
laughed with considerable satisfaction, and said: &#8220;Ah, the professor:
he&#8217;s a bit off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Agnes kept house for him; she was most faithful in looking out
for his wants. When he would leave the house, she would bring
him his hat and walking stick. Every evening before she went to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>sleep, he would come in to her and kiss her on the forehead. It
was rare that they spoke with each other, but there was a secret
agreement, a peaceful harmony, between them.</p>

<p>Gottfried grew up to be a strong, healthy boy. He had Daniel&#8217;s
physique and Eleanore&#8217;s eyes. Yes, they were the eyes with that
blue fire; and they had Eleanore&#8217;s elfin-like chastity and her hatred
of all that is false and simulated. Daniel saw in this a freak of
nature of the profoundest significance. All the laws of blood
seemed unsubstantial and shadowy. His feelings often wandered
between gratitude and astonishment.</p>

<p>Of Dorothea he heard one day that she was making her living
as a violinist in a woman&#8217;s orchestra. He made some inquiries and
traced her as far as Berlin. There he lost her. A few years later
he was told that she had become the mistress of a wealthy country
gentleman in Bohemia, and was driving about in an automobile on
the Riviera.</p>

<p>He was also informed of the death of Herr Carovius. His last
hours were said to have been very hard: he had kept crying out,
&#8220;My flute, give me my flute!&#8221;</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>In August, 1909, Daniel&#8217;s pupils celebrated the fiftieth birthday
of their master. They made him a great number of presents, and
gave him a dinner in the inn at the Sign of the Ox.</p>

<p>One of his pupils, an extremely handsome young fellow for
whose future Daniel had the highest of hopes, presented him with a
huge bouquet of orange lilies, wild natives of the woods around
Eschenbach. He had gathered them himself, and arranged them in
a costly vase.</p>

<p>The menu at the dinner was quite frugal; the wine was
Franconian country wine. During the dinner, Daniel rose, took his
glass in his hand, and, with a far-away look in his eyes, said: &#8220;I
drink to the health and happiness of a creature who is a stranger
to all of you. She grew up here in Eschenbach. Many years ago
she vanished in a most mysterious way. But I know that she is
alive and happy at this hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>His pupils all raised their glasses. They looked at him, and
were deeply moved by the strength and clarity of his features.</p>

<p>After the dinner he and his pupils went to the old church. He
had both of the large doors opened so that the bright light of day
might pour in unimpeded. Up in the lofty vaults of the nave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
where all had been dark but a moment ago, there was now a milky
clearness and cheerfulness.</p>

<p>He went to the organ and began to play. Some men and women
who chanced to be passing by came in and sat down on the benches
with the boys. Then a group of children entered. They tripped
timidly through the open doors, stopped, looked around, and
opened their eyes as wide as children can. Other people came in;
for the tones of the organ had penetrated the humble homes.
They looked up at the organ silently and seriously; for its exalted
melodies had, without their being prepared for it, carried them
away from their everyday existence, and lifted them up above its
abject lowliness.</p>

<p>The tones grew louder and louder, until they sounded like the
prayer of a heart overflowing with feeling. As the close of the
great hymn drew on, a little girl was heard weeping from among
the uninvited auditors.</p>

<p>It was Agnes who wept. Had life been fully awakened in her?
Was love calling her out into the unknown? Was the life of her
mother being repeated in her?</p>

<p>Children grow up and are seized by their fate.</p>

<p>Toward evening, Daniel took a walk with his nine pupils out
over the meadow. They went quite far. The last song of the
birds had died out, the glow of the sun had turned pale.</p>

<p>The beautiful youth, then walking by Daniel&#8217;s side, said: &#8220;And
the work, Master?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel merely smiled; his eye roamed over the landscape.</p>

<p>The landscape shows many shades of green. Around the weirs
the grass is higher, so high at times that one can see nothing of the
geese but their beaks. Were it not for their cackling, one might
take these beaks for strangely mobile flowers.</p>
